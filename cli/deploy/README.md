## Overview

The deployment CLI implements a comprehensive set of commands for managing infrastructure deployments across multiple cloud providers and environments. Using Flask's CLI integration with Click, it provides standardized interfaces for AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and Docker deployments. The CLI follows consistent patterns for environment configuration, validation, deployment, status checking, and resource cleanup to ensure reliable operations across all deployment targets.

## Key Components

- **`__init__.py`**: Command-line interface module initialization
  - CLI group registration
  - Command import and organization
  - Exports and public interface
  - Sub-command group registration
  - Module documentation

- **`aws.py`**: AWS deployment commands
  - CloudFormation-based deployment
  - Resource deployment and management
  - Stack creation and updates
  - Status checking and monitoring
  - Teardown and cleanup operations

- **`azure.py`**: Azure deployment commands
  - ARM template-based deployment
  - Resource group management
  - Deployment status monitoring
  - Resource cleanup and deletion
  - Azure service management

- **`docker.py`**: Docker container operations
  - Container image building
  - Docker Compose orchestration
  - Image registry operations
  - Resource cleanup and pruning
  - Container environment management
  - Image verification and validation

- **`gcp.py`**: Google Cloud Platform commands
  - Deployment Manager-based provisioning
  - GCP project management
  - Deployment monitoring
  - Resource teardown and deletion
  - Cloud service configuration

- **`general.py`**: Provider-agnostic commands
  - Configuration validation
  - Environment listing and creation
  - Deployment preparation
  - Cross-provider operations
  - Monitoring and reporting
  - File integrity verification
  - Environment comparison
  - Deployment status monitoring
  - Resource cleanup

- **`kubernetes.py`**: Kubernetes deployment commands
  - Manifest-based deployment
  - Namespace management
  - Deployment status monitoring
  - Cluster resource management
  - Deployment teardown
  - Individual manifest application
  - Detailed resource inspection

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required cloud provider SDKs installed:
  - AWS CLI (for AWS deployments)
  - Azure CLI (for Azure deployments)
  - Google Cloud SDK (for GCP deployments)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for container operations)
- kubectl (for Kubernetes deployments)

## Security Features

- **Access Validation**: Checks for appropriate credentials before operations
- **Configuration Validation**: Validates deployment configurations before application
- **Credential Handling**: Secure credential handling across providers
- **Dry Run Support**: Simulation mode for validating changes without applying them
- **Environment Separation**: Clear separation between development, staging, and production
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error capturing with proper logging
- **Input Validation**: Validation of all command parameters
- **Logging**: Detailed logging of all deployment operations
- **Permission Verification**: Validation of required permissions before deployment
- **Resource Isolation**: Proper namespace and resource group isolation
- **File Integrity**: Verification of critical file integrity before deployment

## Common Features

- **Confirmation Prompts**: Confirmations for destructive operations
- **Cross-Provider Support**: Consistent interfaces across cloud providers
- **Environment-Awareness**: Environment-specific configuration and deployment
- **Error Recovery**: Clean handling of failed deployments
- **Idempotent Operations**: Safe to run commands multiple times
- **Progress Reporting**: Visual progress indicators for long-running operations
- **Resource Tagging**: Consistent tagging across cloud resources
- **Status Checking**: Deployment status verification
- **Teardown Capabilities**: Complete resource cleanup when needed
- **Validation**: Pre-deployment validation of configurations and dependencies

## Usage Examples

### General Commands

```bash
# Prepare application for deployment
flask deploy general prepare --env production

# List available environments
flask deploy general list

# Initialize a new environment
flask deploy general init-env staging --template production

# Validate configuration files
flask deploy general validate --env production

# Verify file integrity
flask deploy general verify-integrity --env production --fail-on-changes

# Compare configurations between environments
flask deploy general diff development production --output diff.txt

# Check deployment status across environments
flask deploy general status --env production

# Clean up deployment artifacts
flask deploy general cleanup --env development --artifacts --backup
```

### AWS Deployments

```bash
# Deploy to AWS using CloudFormation
flask deploy aws deploy --env production --region us-west-2

# Check AWS deployment status
flask deploy aws status --env production

# Tear down AWS deployment
flask deploy aws teardown --env production
```

### Azure Deployments

```bash
# Deploy to Azure using ARM templates
flask deploy azure deploy --env production --resource-group my-resource-group

# Check Azure deployment status
flask deploy azure status --env production

# Tear down Azure deployment
flask deploy azure teardown --env production
```

### Docker Operations

```bash
# Build Docker image
flask deploy docker build --env production --push --registry my-registry

# Run Docker Compose operations
flask deploy docker compose --env production --action up

# Clean up Docker resources
flask deploy docker prune

# Verify Docker image integrity
flask deploy docker verify-image my-image:tag --output report.json
```

### GCP Deployments

```bash
# Deploy to GCP using Deployment Manager
flask deploy gcp deploy --env production --project my-gcp-project

# Check GCP deployment status
flask deploy gcp status --env production

# Tear down GCP deployment
flask deploy gcp teardown --env production
```

### Kubernetes Deployments

```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes cluster
flask deploy k8s deploy --env production --namespace my-namespace

# Check Kubernetes deployment status
flask deploy k8s status --env production --detailed

# Apply a specific Kubernetes manifest
flask deploy k8s apply --env production --file deployment/kubernetes/service.yaml

# Tear down Kubernetes deployment
flask deploy k8s teardown --env production

# Tear down specific resources while retaining others
flask deploy k8s teardown --env production --retain-resources configmaps --retain-resources secrets
```
