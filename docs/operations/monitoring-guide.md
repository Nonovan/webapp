# Monitoring Guide

This guide outlines the monitoring strategy and tools used for the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

## Overview

Our monitoring system provides comprehensive visibility into application performance, infrastructure health, and security posture. It enables proactive identification of issues before they impact users and provides insights for optimization.

## Monitoring Architecture

The monitoring architecture consists of:

1. **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus for storing and querying time-series metrics
2. **Log Aggregation**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log collection and analysis
3. **Alerting**: Alertmanager for notification delivery and management
4. **Visualization**: Grafana dashboards for metrics visualization
5. **Synthetic Monitoring**: Regular health checks and simulated user journeys
6. **APM (Application Performance Monitoring)**: Detailed application performance insights

## Health Checks

Our `health-check.sh` script provides comprehensive health status for any environment:

```bash
# Run basic health check
./health-check.sh production

# Output in JSON format for programmatic consumption
OUTPUT_FORMAT=json ./health-check.sh production

# Send health check report by email
./health-check.sh production --email admin@example.com
```

The health check verifies:

- API endpoint availability
- Database connectivity
- Memory and disk usage
- SSL certificate validity
- Service status
- Security updates
- Log analysis for errors

## Metrics Monitoring

### Key Metrics

We monitor the following key metrics:

#### System Metrics

- CPU, Memory, Disk usage
- Network traffic
- Load average

#### Application Metrics

- Request rate and response time
- Error rate
- Endpoint-specific performance
- Cache hit/miss ratio
- Background job queue size

#### Database Metrics

- Query performance
- Connection pool usage
- Transaction rate
- Table/index size growth

#### Security Metrics

- Failed login attempts
- WAF rule triggers
- Access pattern anomalies
- Security scan results

### Accessing Metrics

Metrics are available through:

1. **Prometheus**: [http://monitoring.example.com:9090](http://monitoring.example.com:9090/)
2. **Grafana Dashboards**: [http://monitoring.example.com:3000](http://monitoring.example.com:3000/)
    - Main Dashboard: Overview of all critical metrics
    - Application Dashboard: Detailed application metrics
    - Infrastructure Dashboard: System-level metrics
    - Database Dashboard: Database performance metrics
    - Security Dashboard: Security-related metrics

## Log Monitoring

Application and system logs are centralized in our ELK stack:

1. **Access Logs**: All HTTP requests with response codes and times
2. **Application Logs**: Application-specific events and errors
3. **Security Logs**: Authentication events, access attempts, and security alerts
4. **System Logs**: OS and infrastructure events

### Log Access

- **Kibana**: [http://logs.example.com](http://logs.example.com/)
- **Log CLI**: `./scripts/fetch_logs.sh --app --env production --hours 24`

## Alerting

Alerts are configured for various conditions that require attention:

### Alert Channels

- Email notifications
- PagerDuty for critical alerts
- Slack for team notifications
- SMS for urgent issues

### Alert Severity Levels

1. **Critical**: Immediate action required (service down, data loss risk)
2. **Warning**: Action required soon (approaching resource limits, degraded performance)
3. **Info**: No immediate action required (noteworthy events, potential issues)

### Common Alerts

- High error rate (>1% of requests)
- API response time above threshold (>500ms p95)
- Host CPU sustained high usage (>90% for 5 minutes)
- Low disk space (<10% free)
- Database connection pool nearing capacity
- Failed security checks
- Certificate expiration approaching (30 days)

## Incident Response

When alerts trigger:

1. **Acknowledgment**: Acknowledge the alert in the alerting system
2. **Investigation**: Use monitoring tools to diagnose the issue
3. **Mitigation**: Address the immediate problem
4. **Resolution**: Implement a permanent solution
5. **Post-mortem**: Document the incident and preventive measures

## Scheduled Health Reports

Daily health reports are automatically generated and distributed:

- Executive summary report (daily)
- Detailed technical report (weekly)
- Trend analysis report (monthly)

## Custom Monitoring

To add custom monitoring:

1. **Custom Metrics**: Add Prometheus metrics to the application code
2. **Custom Health Checks**: Extend the health check script
3. **Custom Dashboards**: Create specialized Grafana dashboards
4. **Custom Alerts**: Define new alert rules in Alertmanager

## Setting Up Monitoring for New Deployments

For new environments:

```bash
# Deploy monitoring stack
./deploy_monitoring.sh staging

# Configure environment-specific alerts
./configure_alerts.sh staging

# Set up custom dashboards
./import_dashboards.sh staging
```

## Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Signal vs. Noise**: Focus on actionable alerts; avoid alert fatigue
2. **Correlation**: Correlate metrics, logs, and events for faster diagnosis
3. **Baselines**: Establish performance baselines for normal operation
4. **Trending**: Monitor trends over time, not just absolute values
5. **Documentation**: Keep runbooks updated for all critical alerts
6. **Testing**: Regularly test alerting and incident response procedures

## Troubleshooting Monitoring Issues

- **Missing Data**: Check Prometheus targets and scrapers
- **Alert Failures**: Verify Alertmanager configuration and connectivity
- **Dashboard Issues**: Check Grafana datasource configuration
- **Log Gaps**: Verify Logstash and Filebeat configurations
