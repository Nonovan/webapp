# Operations Overview

This document provides a guide to the operational aspects of the Cloud Infrastructure Platform, including deployment, monitoring, maintenance, and security procedures.

## Operational Components

The platform's operations are organized into the following key areas:

### Deployment Management

- **Continuous Deployment**: Automated release pipelines with CI/CD integration
- **Environment Management**: Consistent configurations across development, staging, and production
- **Rollback Procedures**: Processes for safely reverting to previous versions
- **Configuration Management**: Version-controlled environment configurations

### Monitoring & Alerting

- **Health Checks**: Regular verification of system and service status
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of system metrics and performance
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with search and analysis capabilities
- **Alert Management**: Notification systems for critical events and thresholds

### Maintenance Operations

- **Database Maintenance**: Backup, recovery, and optimization procedures
- **Security Updates**: Regular patching and security hardening
- **Resource Optimization**: Performance tuning and capacity planning
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Routine maintenance activities and housekeeping

### Security Operations

- **Access Control**: User authentication and authorization management
- **Threat Detection**: Monitoring for suspicious activities and intrusion attempts
- **Compliance Checks**: Regular audits against security standards
- **Incident Response**: Procedures for handling security incidents

## Operational Scripts

The platform includes various scripts to automate common operational tasks:

### Deployment Scripts

- `deploy.sh` - Main deployment script for application updates
- `pre_deploy_check.sh` - Validates prerequisites before deployment
- `post_deploy_check.sh` - Verifies successful deployment
- `rollback.sh` - Reverts to a previous stable version
- `restore_db.sh` - Restores database from backups

### Monitoring Scripts

- `health-check.sh` - Comprehensive system health verification
- `smoke-test.sh` - Quick verification of core functionality
- `performance-test.sh` - Load testing and performance benchmarking
- `monitoring-setup.sh` - Configures monitoring systems and alerts

### Maintenance Scripts

- `backup.sh` - Creates application and database backups
- `db_maintenance.sh` - Performs database optimization tasks
- `rotate_logs.sh` - Manages log rotation and archival
- `collect_static.sh` - Optimizes static assets for production

### Security Scripts

- `security_audit.py` - Performs security scanning and compliance checks
- `security_setup.sh` - Configures and updates security controls
- `ssl-setup.sh` - Manages SSL certificates
- `update-modsecurity-rules.sh` - Updates WAF rules
- `iptables-rules.sh` - Manages firewall configurations

## Usage Guidelines

### Environment Support

All operational scripts support multiple environments and should be called with the target environment as the first parameter:

```bash
./deploy.sh production
./health-check.sh staging
```

### Common Patterns

Operational scripts follow these consistent patterns:

- **Environment-aware**: Adapt behavior based on the target environment
- **Idempotent**: Can be run multiple times with the same result
- **Verbose Logging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with meaningful error messages
- **Exit Codes**: Standardized exit codes for automation integration

### Security Considerations

- Scripts that manage sensitive operations require appropriate privileges
- Production environment actions require additional confirmation
- Credentials are loaded from secure environment files, never hardcoded
- All script executions are logged for audit purposes

## Operational Procedures

### Routine Operations

- Daily health checks and monitoring review
- Weekly security updates and patch management
- Monthly performance review and optimization
- Quarterly security audits and compliance checks

### Incident Response

- Defined severity levels and escalation paths
- On-call rotation and response SLAs
- Post-incident analysis and improvement process
- Communication templates for stakeholder updates

### Change Management

- Change request and approval workflow
- Risk assessment for significant changes
- Scheduled maintenance windows
- Change documentation requirements
