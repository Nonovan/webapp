# Deployment Scripts

This directory contains scripts for deploying, testing, maintaining, and monitoring the Cloud Infrastructure Platform across various environments.

## Overview

The scripts in this directory automate common deployment and operational tasks, ensuring consistency and reliability across environments. They follow our security best practices and include proper error handling and logging.

## Available Scripts

### Deployment Scripts

- `deploy.sh` - Main deployment script for application updates
- `rollback.sh` - Rolls back to a previous version if deployment issues occur
- `pre_deploy_check.sh` - Pre-deployment validation to prevent failed deployments
- `post_deploy_check.sh` - Post-deployment validation to verify successful deployment
- `restore_db.sh` - Restores database from backup

### Testing Scripts

- `smoke-test.sh` - Quick verification of core functionality post-deployment
- `performance-test.sh` - Load testing and performance benchmarking
- `security_audit.py` - Security scanning and compliance verification

### Maintenance Scripts

- `health-check.sh` - Checks system and application health
- `collect_static.sh` - Collects and optimizes static assets for production
- `rotate_logs.sh` - Log rotation and archival
- `security_setup.sh` - Sets up and updates security controls

### Infrastructure Scripts

- `ssl-setup.sh` - Manages SSL certificates
- `update-modsecurity-rules.sh` - Updates WAF rules
- `iptables-rules.sh` - Configures firewall rules

## Usage Guidelines

### Environment Support

All scripts support multiple environments (development, staging, production) and should be called with the target environment as the first parameter:

```bash
./deploy.sh production
./health-check.sh staging

```

### Common Patterns

Scripts follow these common patterns:

- Accept environment as first parameter
- Fail fast with meaningful error messages
- Log to both console and log files
- Return appropriate exit codes for automation

### Security Considerations

- Scripts that manage sensitive operations require appropriate privileges
- Production environment actions may require additional confirmation
- Credentials are never hardcoded and are loaded from environment files
