# Disaster Recovery Plan

This document outlines the procedures and strategies for recovering the Cloud Infrastructure Platform in case of a disaster or system failure.

## Overview

The disaster recovery (DR) plan provides a structured approach for responding to incidents that cause significant disruption to the Cloud Infrastructure Platform. It ensures business continuity by defining clear recovery procedures, roles, and responsibilities for both cloud infrastructure and integrated industrial control systems (ICS).

## Objectives

- Minimize downtime and data loss in disaster scenarios
- Provide clear recovery procedures for different types of disasters
- Define roles and responsibilities during recovery operations
- Ensure regular testing and improvement of recovery processes
- Meet compliance requirements for business continuity (ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST)
- Maintain security controls throughout the recovery process

## Recovery Metrics

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

| Environment | RTO Target |
| --- | --- |
| Production | 2 hours |
| Staging | 4 hours |
| Development | 8 hours |

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

| Environment | RPO Target |
| --- | --- |
| Production | 15 minutes |
| Staging | 1 hour |
| Development | 24 hours |

## Disaster Recovery Team

| Role | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| DR Coordinator | Oversees recovery efforts, coordinates team members, communicates with leadership |
| System Administrators | Perform system recovery, manage infrastructure restoration |
| Database Administrators | Handle database backup and restoration using scripts in database |
| Network Engineers | Restore network connectivity and configurations |
| Security Team | Verify security controls during recovery, investigate security incidents |
| Application Team | Validate application functionality after recovery |
| ICS Specialists | Recover and validate industrial control system components |
| Cloud Providers Team | Coordinate with cloud providers for infrastructure recovery |
| Communications Lead | Manage stakeholder communications throughout recovery process |

## Disaster Scenarios and Response

### Infrastructure Failure

### Symptoms

- Complete loss of access to cloud provider resources
- Multiple service alerts from monitoring systems
- Inability to access application endpoints

### Response

1. Activate DR team and establish command center
2. Assess scope of failure across regions and services
3. Initiate failover to secondary region if primary region is affected
4. Restore core infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates
5. Restore databases from latest backups using restore_db.sh
6. Verify system integrity and functionality using [health-check.sh](see `scripts/monitoring/health-check.sh`)
7. Update DNS and routing to point to recovered systems

### Security Breach

### Symptoms

- Security monitoring alerts indicating unauthorized access
- Unexpected system behavior or modifications
- Evidence of data exfiltration or tampering

### Response

1. Isolate affected systems to prevent further compromise
2. Initiate security incident response plan (see `docs/security/incident-response.md`)
3. Create forensic copies of affected systems before recovery
4. Restore systems from known-clean backups
5. Apply security patches and update configurations
6. Reset all credentials and access tokens
7. Perform security verification before returning to service
8. Coordinate with legal and compliance teams for any required notifications

### Application Failure

### Symptoms

- Critical application components unresponsive
- High error rates in application logs
- Services failing health checks

### Response

1. Identify failed components through monitoring dashboards
2. Attempt service restart using standard procedures
3. If restart fails, roll back to last known good version using [rollback.sh](see `scripts/deployment/rollback.sh`)
4. If rollback is unsuccessful, rebuild application environment
5. Restore application data if necessary
6. Verify application functionality through smoke tests
7. Route traffic to recovered application

## Recovery Procedures

### System Recovery

```bash
# 1. Deploy infrastructure from IaC templates
cd deployment/infrastructure
terraform apply -var-file=dr-recovery.tfvars

# 2. Restore configuration
./deployment/scripts/config_restore.sh --env production --source s3://backup-bucket/configs/

# 3. Deploy application
./deployment/scripts/deploy.sh production --from-backup

```

### Database Recovery

```bash
# 1. Find appropriate backup
ls -la /var/backups/cloud-platform/database/

# 2. Restore database
./deployment/scripts/restore_db.sh /var/backups/cloud-platform/database/cloud_platform_production_YYYYMMDD.sql.gz production

# 3. Verify database integrity
./deployment/scripts/db_verify.sh production

```

### Application Recovery

```bash
# 1. Roll back to last known good version
./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh production --version v2.1.0

# 2. If rollback fails, perform fresh deployment
./deployment/scripts/deploy.sh production --clean

# 3. Run post-deployment checks
./deployment/scripts/post_deploy_check.sh production

```

## Failover Architecture

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform uses a multi-region architecture to support disaster recovery:

1. **Primary Region**: Main operational region with full application stack
2. **Secondary Region**: Standby environment for failover operations
3. **Data Replication**: Near real-time replication of database and storage
4. **Global Load Balancing**: Traffic routing between regions based on health
5. **Configuration Sync**: Automated synchronization of configuration between regions

### Failover Process

```bash
# 1. Verify primary region failure
./deployment/scripts/health-check.sh production --region primary

# 2. Activate secondary region
./deployment/scripts/dr-failover.sh --activate-region secondary

# 3. Update DNS and routing
./deployment/scripts/update-dns.sh --point-to secondary

# 4. Verify secondary region functionality
./deployment/scripts/smoke-test.sh production --region secondary

```

## Backup Strategy

See the detailed Backup Strategy document for complete information.

### Key Backup Components

1. **Database Backups**
    - Full daily backups with hourly incremental backups
    - Multi-tier storage strategy with hot and cold storage
    - Point-in-time recovery capability for production
2. **Configuration Backups**
    - Versioned storage of all configuration files
    - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates in version control
    - Automated configuration backups before changes
3. **File Storage Backups**
    - Daily snapshots of file storage volumes
    - Cross-region replication for critical files
    - Retention policies based on data classification

### Backup Verification

All backups are automatically verified through:

- Checksum validation
- Periodic test restores
- Backup integrity monitoring
