## Overview

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform is designed as a modular, cloud-agnostic application with microservices-inspired architecture. It provides infrastructure management, monitoring, and automation capabilities while maintaining high availability, scalability, and security.

## API Architecture

The platform exposes REST APIs organized into the following categories:

- auth - Authentication and authorization endpoints
- cloud - Cloud resource management endpoints
- `/api/monitor/` - Monitoring and alerting endpoints
- newsletter - Communication and notification endpoints
- webhooks - Webhook registration and delivery endpoints

APIs follow these design principles:

- API versioning
- Comprehensive documentation via Swagger/OpenAPI
- Consistent error handling
- Resource-oriented design

## Core Components

### Application Layers

The platform is organized into the following layers:

1. **Business Logic Layer**
   - Automation engine
   - Core services
   - Orchestration services
   - Workflow engine

2. **Data Layer**
   - Caching layer (Redis)
   - Object storage
   - Primary database (PostgreSQL)
   - Time-series metrics storage

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Cloud provider connectors
   - Event bus
   - External API integrations
   - Webhook handlers

4. **Presentation Layer**
   - API gateway
   - CLI tools
   - Notification systems

## Database Architecture

### Schema Design

The database follows a normalized schema design with focused tables that map to domain models. Key schema components include:

- Monitoring data (metadata, not time-series)
- Users and permissions
- Workflow definitions and state

### Data Flow

1. Application services communicate with the database through ORM (SQLAlchemy)
2. Read-heavy operations leverage caching and read replicas
3. Write operations go to the primary database node
4. Time-series data flows to specialized storage

## Deployment Architecture
