# Security Incident Response Plan

This document outlines the procedures and responsibilities for responding to security incidents affecting the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

## Overview

A security incident is an event that potentially compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information systems or data. This plan provides structured guidance for identifying, responding to, and recovering from security incidents while minimizing their impact on business operations and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

| **Low** | Minimal impact with no immediate risk | - Suspicious activity<br>- Minor policy violation<br>- Isolated scanning attempts | Within 24 hours |

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Preparation

**Ongoing activities:**

- Maintain up-to-date contact information
- Regular testing of incident response procedures
- Security awareness training for all staff
- Maintain necessary tools and resources
- Document system configurations and baselines

### 2. Detection and Identification

**Sources of incident detection:**

- Security monitoring systems (SIEM)
- Intrusion detection/prevention systems
- Anti-malware alerts
- System/application logs
- User reports
- Third-party notifications

**Initial assessment:**

- Determine if the event is a security incident
- Identify affected systems and data
- Assess potential impact and scope
- Assign initial severity level
- Create incident ticket in tracking system

### 3. Containment

**Short-term containment:**

- Isolate affected systems
- Block malicious IP addresses/domains
- Disable compromised accounts
- Preserve evidence and forensic data
- Document all actions taken

**Long-term containment:**

- Patch vulnerabilities
- Strengthen access controls
- Apply additional security measures
- Deploy monitoring for similar attacks

### 4. Eradication

- Remove malware or unauthorized access tools
- Identify and close all access vectors
- Reset compromised credentials
- Verify system integrity
- Conduct vulnerability scanning
- Address security gaps that enabled the incident

### 5. Recovery

- Restore systems from clean backups
- Bring systems back online in phases
- Implement additional security controls
- Monitor for signs of persistent threats
- Verify system functionality and security
- Return to normal operations

### 6. Lessons Learned

- Conduct post-incident review meeting
- Document incident timeline and response
- Identify what worked well and what didn't
- Update response procedures as needed
- Address identified security weaknesses
- Share applicable lessons with appropriate teams
- Update training and awareness materials

## Incident Response Procedures

### For System Administrators

1. **Initial Response**
    - Document all actions in the incident log
    - Implement immediate containment measures
    - Preserve evidence before making changes
    - Capture system state (memory, logs, running processes)
2. **System Isolation**
    - Disconnect compromised systems from the network if necessary
    - Create forensic images before shutdown if possible
    - Use read-only tools for investigation
3. **System Recovery**
