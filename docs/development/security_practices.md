## Overview

Security must be integrated into all phases of the development process, from requirements and design through implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. These security practices align with our compliance requirements (ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and others) while ensuring a secure and resilient platform.

## Secure Development Lifecycle

### 1. Requirements & Planning

- Consider privacy and data protection requirements (GDPR, HIPAA)
- Define acceptable risk thresholds for features handling sensitive data
- Document security assumptions and dependencies
- Include security requirements in user stories and requirements documents
- Perform threat modeling for new features with security implications

### 2. Design

- Consider authorization boundaries and trust relationships
- Design for secure defaults and fail-secure behavior
- Design with defense-in-depth approach (multiple security layers)
- Document authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Follow the principle of least privilege in system architecture
- Implement security controls appropriate to data classification levels
- Incorporate privacy by design principles

### 3. Implementation

#### Secure Coding Practices

- Apply contextual output encoding for XSS prevention
- Avoid deprecated or insecure functions and libraries
- Follow the [OWASP Secure Coding Practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/)
- Implement proper input validation and output encoding
- Keep dependencies updated and regularly scan for vulnerabilities
- Use parameterized queries for all database operations

#### Authentication & Authorization

- Apply principle of least privilege for all roles
- Implement multi-factor authentication where appropriate
- Implement proper access control at API and controller levels
- Implement proper session management with secure defaults
- Use secure random number generators for security-critical functions
- Use strong, adaptive password policies

#### Data Protection

- Apply data minimization principles
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement data retention and deletion policies
- Implement proper key management practices
- Use secure methods for logging and error handling
- Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms

### 4. Testing

- Conduct dynamic application security testing (DAST)
- Implement software composition analysis for dependencies
- Include security testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Perform regular penetration testing per procedures in penetration-testing.md
- Perform static application security testing (SAST)
- Test security controls and fail-safe mechanisms
- Validate security requirements from the requirements phase

### 5. Deployment

- Follow security hardening guidelines in security README
- Implement proper key and certificate management
- Implement secure configuration management
- Perform pre-deployment security verification
- Use infrastructure-as-code with security scanning
- Use secure deployment practices (immutable infrastructure when possible)
- Verify all security controls are enabled in production

### 6. Maintenance

- Apply security patches promptly
- Conduct ongoing security monitoring
- Implement change management with security reviews
- Perform regular vulnerability assessments
- Regularly review and update security documentation
- Update threat models when architecture changes

## Security Controls

### API Security

- Add appropriate security headers to API responses
- Document security controls in API specifications
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- Implement rate limiting and throttling
- Use proper authentication for all API endpoints
- Validate all API input and implement integrity checks

### Database Security

- Apply the principle of least privilege for database accounts
- Encrypt sensitive data in the database
- Implement proper database backup and recovery procedures
- Implement row-level security where appropriate
- Regularly audit database access patterns
- Use parameterized queries or ORMs with proper escaping
- Use secure connection strings and credential management

### Frontend Security

- Apply secure cookie flags (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite)
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Implement CSRF protection for all forms
- Sanitize all user-generated content before rendering
- Use security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
- Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external resources

## Security Tools and Resources

### Required Security Tools

- DAST: OWASP ZAP for dynamic security testing
- Dependency Scanning: Dependabot or similar for dependency checking
- Infrastructure Scanning: Terraform/CloudFormation security scanning
- SAST: SonarQube integration in CI/CD pipeline
- Secrets Scanning: git-secrets or similar to prevent credential leaks

### Security Review Process

1. Security design review for significant features
2. Code review with security focus
3. Security testing results review
4. Pre-deployment security verification
5. Post-deployment security validation

### Training and Resources

- Access to security testing tools and documentation
- Language-specific secure coding guidelines
- Regular security brown-bag sessions
- Required annual security awareness training
- Security champions program

## Incident Response

1. Familiarize yourself with the Security Incident Response Procedures
2. Know how to report security issues:
   - Development security concerns: Open security issue in project tracker
   - Internal vulnerabilities: [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
   - Production incidents: Follow incident response procedure
3. Practice security incident tabletop exercises

## Compliance Requirements

Security practices in development must support our compliance with:

- FedRAMP (in progress)
- GDPR requirements for privacy by design
- Industry-specific regulations (HIPAA, PCI DSS) where applicable
- ISO 27001 Controls (see compliance.md)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- SOC 2 Type II Trust Service Criteria
