# Alert Management Guide

## Overview

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform provides a robust alerting system to help you monitor resources and respond quickly to issues. This guide explains how to set up, manage, and respond to alerts effectively.

## Understanding Alerts

Alerts notify you when predefined conditions are met in your cloud resources or infrastructure. These conditions might indicate:

- Performance issues (high CPU/memory usage)
- Availability problems (service downtime)
- Security concerns (unusual access patterns)
- Resource constraints (low disk space)
- Cost thresholds (budget limits reached)

## Alert Severity Levels

Alerts are categorized by severity to help you prioritize your response:

| Severity | Description | Example | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Severe impact on production systems | Service outage, data breach | Immediate |
| **High** | Significant impact on performance | CPU at 95%, approaching capacity limits | Within hours |
| **Medium** | Potential issues that need attention | Increasing error rates, disk space at 80% | Within a day |
| **Low** | Informational alerts | Cost threshold reached, minor configuration issues | When convenient |
| **Info** | System notifications | Automated actions completed, resource created | No action required |

## Setting Up Alert Rules

### Creating a Basic Alert Rule

1. Navigate to **Alerts** → **Rules** in the main menu
2. Click **Create Alert Rule**
3. Configure the following settings:
   - **Name**: Provide a descriptive name
   - **Resource Type**: Select the resource type (VM, database, etc.)
   - **Resources**: Choose specific resources or select "All" for resource type
   - **Metric**: Select the metric to monitor (CPU, memory, disk space, etc.)
   - **Condition**: Define the threshold condition (e.g., > 90%)
   - **Duration**: How long the condition must persist (e.g., 5 minutes)
   - **Severity**: Select the appropriate severity level
   - **Description**: Add details to help responders understand the alert
4. Click **Save Rule**

### Advanced Alert Configuration

For more sophisticated alerting needs:

#### Multiple Conditions

1. When creating a rule, click **Add Condition**
2. Configure additional conditions
3. Choose the condition relationship (**AND** or **OR**)

#### Alert Suppression

To prevent alert storms during known issues:

1. Go to **Alerts** → **Suppression Rules**
2. Click **Create Suppression Rule**
3. Define the criteria for suppressing alerts
4. Set a duration for the suppression
5. Add a reason for documentation

## Configuring Alert Notifications

Alerts can be delivered through multiple channels:

### Available Notification Channels

1. **Email**: Notifications sent to specified email addresses
2. **SMS**: Text messages for urgent alerts
3. **Webhooks**: Integration with external systems
4. **In-app**: Notifications within the platform interface

### Setting Up Notification Preferences

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Notifications**
2. Configure your preferred notification methods for each severity level
3. Optionally set up notification schedules (business hours vs. off-hours)

### Creating Notification Groups

For team-based alert management:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Notification Groups**
2. Click **Create Group**
3. Add team members to the group
4. Configure notification methods for the group
5. Assign the group to specific alert rules or resource groups

## Responding to Alerts

### Alert Workflow

1. **Notification**: You receive an alert notification
2. **Review**: Assess the alert details and resource metrics
3. **Acknowledge**: Indicate you're investigating the alert
4. **Investigate**: Determine the root cause
5. **Resolve**: Fix the issue and mark the alert as resolved

### Acknowledging Alerts

To acknowledge an alert:

1. Navigate to **Alerts** → **Active Alerts**
2. Find the alert in the list
3. Click the **Acknowledge** button
4. Optionally add notes about your investigation

### Resolving Alerts

Once the issue is fixed:

1. Return to the alert details page
2. Click **Resolve Alert**
3. Select a resolution type:
   - **Fixed**: Issue was resolved
   - **False Positive**: Alert triggered incorrectly
   - **Expected Behavior**: Not actually an issue
   - **Other**: Special cases (requires explanation)
4. Add resolution notes for documentation purposes
5. Click **Submit**

## Alert History and Analysis

### Viewing Alert History

1. Navigate to **Alerts** → **History**
2. Use filters to narrow down alerts by:
   - Time range
   - Severity
   - Resource type
   - Resolution status
   - Keywords

### Alert Metrics and Reporting

Access alert analytics to identify patterns:

1. Navigate to **Alerts** → **Analytics**
2. View metrics such as:
   - Most common alert types
   - Average time to acknowledgment
   - Average time to resolution
   - Alert volume by resource
   - False positive rate

## Alert Best Practices

### Setting Effective Thresholds

- Start with conservative thresholds and adjust as needed
- Consider normal usage patterns when setting thresholds
- Use percentages rather than absolute values when possible
- Set graduated thresholds (warning before critical)

### Reducing Alert Fatigue

- Only alert on actionable conditions
- Consolidate related alerts
- Implement proper alert severity classification
- Use alert suppression during maintenance periods
- Regularly review and refine alert rules

### Documenting Alert Response

- Create runbooks for common alerts
- Document resolution steps for recurring issues
- Update documentation after each major incident
- Share knowledge across the team

## Integrating with Automation

### Automated Remediation

Some alerts can trigger automatic remediation:

1. Navigate to **Automation** → **Remediation Rules**
2. Click **Create Rule**
3. Select the alert conditions that trigger automation
4. Define the actions to take (restart service, scale resources, etc.)
5. Set limits on automated actions (max attempts, time window)

### Alert Webhooks

To integrate alerts with external systems:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Webhooks**
2. Click **Add Webhook**
3. Configure the endpoint URL
4. Select the alert types to send
5. Configure authentication if required
6. Test the webhook configuration

## Troubleshooting Alerts

### Common Alert Issues

- **Missing Alerts**: Check alert rule configuration and notification settings
- **Delayed Alerts**: Verify monitoring service is running properly
- **False Positives**: Adjust thresholds or add conditions to increase specificity
- **Alert Storms**: Implement proper correlation and suppression rules

### Alert Diagnostics

1. Navigate to **Alerts** → **Diagnostics**
2. View alert processing logs
3. Check notification delivery status
4. Verify monitoring agent health

## Using Alerts in Disaster Recovery

During disaster recovery scenarios, alerts play a critical role in:

1. **Early Detection**: Identifying issues before they cause service disruption
2. **Recovery Verification**: Confirming systems are properly restored after failover
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Ensuring DR environment meets performance requirements
4. **Security Monitoring**: Detecting potential security issues during recovery

Configure alert thresholds appropriately for DR environments, as they may have different performance characteristics than primary production environments.

## Alert Integration with External Systems

Alerts can be integrated with external systems through:

- **Webhooks**: Send alert data to third-party systems
- **Email**: Route alerts to ticketing systems
- **API**: Pull alert data into custom dashboards
- **Chat Applications**: Route alerts to Slack, Teams, or other collaboration tools
