## API Issues

### API Request Failures

| Problem | Possible Causes | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid or expired API token | Generate a new API token in the user settings |
| 403 Forbidden | Insufficient permissions | Verify API token has appropriate scope and permissions |
| 404 Not Found | Incorrect endpoint URL | Check API documentation for correct endpoint path |
| 429 Too Many Requests | Rate limiting applied | Implement backoff strategy or request rate limit increase |
| 5xx Server Error | Backend service issue | Check system status and retry with exponential backoff |

### Diagnose API Issues

```bash
# Test API connectivity
curl -v <https://api.example.com/health>

# Check API token validity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" <https://api.example.com/api/validate>

# View detailed API logs (admin only)
./scripts/monitoring/api_logs.sh --last 30m

```
