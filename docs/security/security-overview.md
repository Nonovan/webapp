# Security Implementation for Cloud Infrastructure Platform

This directory contains security-related configurations, hardening scripts, and documentation to secure the Cloud Infrastructure Platform across various environments.

## Overview

The security implementation follows a defense-in-depth approach, applying multiple layers of security controls to protect the platform infrastructure, applications, data, and network communications. Our implementation follows industry best practices including NIST Cybersecurity Framework, CIS benchmarks, and OWASP recommendations.

## Usage

### Basic Hardening

To apply basic security hardening to a newly provisioned system:

```bash
# Run the main security setup script
./security_setup.sh [environment]

# Verify the security configuration
./security-audit.sh --report-only

```

### Web Server Security

To configure the web server with security best practices:

```bash
# Copy security configuration files to NGINX directory
cp nginx-hardening.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/
cp ssl-params.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/
cp security-headers.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/

# Setup ModSecurity WAF
./setup-modsecurity.sh

# Update ModSecurity rules
./update-modsecurity-rules.sh

```

### Network Security

To implement network security controls:

```bash
# Configure firewall rules
./iptables-rules.sh

# Setup intrusion prevention
cp fail2ban.local /etc/fail2ban/
cp -r fail2ban-filters/* /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/
systemctl restart fail2ban

```

### Monitoring and Compliance

To enable security monitoring and verify compliance:

```bash
# Setup file integrity monitoring
cp aide.conf /etc/aide/
aide --init
mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new /var/lib/aide/aide.db

# Schedule security tasks
cp security-update-cron /etc/cron.d/cloud-platform-security

# Run security audit
./security-audit.sh --email security@example.com

```

### Certificate Management

For SSL/TLS certificate management:

```bash
# Setup SSL certificates
./ssl-setup.sh --domain cloud-platform.example.com --email admin@example.com

```

## Security Layers

### 1. Infrastructure Security

- Server hardening based on CIS benchmarks
- Host-based firewall configuration
- File integrity monitoring (AIDE)
- Secure boot configuration
- Regular security patching

### 2. Network Security

- Network segmentation and isolation
- Inbound traffic filtering
- Outbound traffic control
- DDoS protection
- Intrusion detection and prevention

### 3. Application Security

- ModSecurity WAF implementation
- HTTP security headers
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization controls
- API security measures

### 4. Data Security

- TLS encryption for data in transit
- Disk encryption for data at rest
- Database security controls
- Secure backup procedures
- Data access monitoring

### 5. Monitoring and Response

- Security event logging
- Centralized log collection
- Real-time alerting
- Incident response procedures
- Security audit trails

## Security Testing

Regular security testing is performed using:

- Vulnerability scanning with OpenVAS/Nessus
- Web application scanning with OWASP ZAP
- Penetration testing by qualified security professionals
- Infrastructure as Code scanning with tfsec
- Dependency vulnerability scanning with OWASP Dependency Check

## Compliance

The security implementation helps maintain compliance with:

- ISO 27001
- SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR
- PCI DSS (where payment processing is involved)
- HIPAA (where health data is involved)

For detailed compliance information, refer to `compliance.md`.

## Best Practices

- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement defense in depth
- Regular security patching and updates
- Security monitoring and incident response
- Regular security assessments and testing
- Employee security awareness training
