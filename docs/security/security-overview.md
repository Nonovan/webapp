# Security Implementation for Cloud Infrastructure Platform

This directory contains security-related configurations, hardening scripts, and documentation to secure the Cloud Infrastructure Platform across various environments.

## Overview

The security implementation follows a defense-in-depth approach, applying multiple layers of security controls to protect the platform infrastructure, applications, data, and network communications.

## Usage

### Basic Hardening

To apply basic security hardening to a new server:

```bash
# Apply firewall rules
sudo bash deployment/security/iptables-rules.sh

# Configure NGINX security
sudo cp deployment/security/nginx-hardening.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/
sudo cp deployment/security/security-headers.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/

# Setup SSL certificates
sudo bash deployment/security/ssl-setup.sh --domain example.com --email admin@example.com

# Install and configure AIDE for file integrity monitoring
sudo cp deployment/security/aide.conf /etc/aide/
sudo aide --init

```

### Web Application Firewall

The ModSecurity WAF implementation uses a layered approach with custom rules organized by security concern:

```bash
# Install core rule set
sudo bash deployment/security/update-modsecurity-rules.sh

# Install custom rule files
sudo cp -r deployment/security/waf-rules/ /etc/nginx/modsecurity.d/

```

### Security Auditing

Run a comprehensive security audit:

```bash
sudo bash deployment/security/security-audit.sh --email admin@example.com

```

### Continuous Monitoring

Schedule regular security checks using the provided cron jobs:

```bash
sudo cp deployment/security/security-update-cron /etc/cron.d/

```

## Database Security

The platform implements comprehensive database security controls:

- Permission-based access control with least privilege
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest
- Regular backup and verification procedures
- Connection pooling and rate limiting to prevent resource exhaustion
- SQL injection protection through prepared statements and WAF rules
- Audit logging for all critical database operations

## ICS Security Features

The Industrial Control System (ICS) security features include:

- Strict network segmentation via network policies
- Special WAF rules for ICS protocols and endpoints
- Command validation and range checking
- Action logging for audit and compliance
- Authentication and authorization specific to control operations

## Compliance

The security implementation helps maintain compliance with:

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 27001
- SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR
- PCI DSS
- HIPAA
- FedRAMP (in progress)

See [compliance.md](deployment/security/compliance.md) for detailed compliance mapping and implementation status.

## Security Architecture
