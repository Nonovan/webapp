## Overview

The security implementation follows a defense-in-depth approach, applying multiple layers of security controls to protect the platform infrastructure, applications, data, and network communications. Our implementation follows industry best practices including NIST Cybersecurity Framework, CIS benchmarks, and OWASP recommendations.

## Usage

### Basic Hardening

To apply basic security hardening to a newly provisioned system:

```bash
# Run the main security setup script
./security_setup.sh [environment]

# Verify the security configuration
./security-audit.sh --report-only
```

### Certificate Management

For SSL/TLS certificate management:

```bash
# Setup SSL certificates
./ssl-setup.sh --domain cloud-platform.example.com --email admin@example.com
```

### Monitoring and Compliance

To enable security monitoring and verify compliance:

```bash
# Setup file integrity monitoring
cp aide.conf /etc/aide/
aide --init
mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new /var/lib/aide/aide.db

# Schedule security tasks
cp security-update-cron /etc/cron.d/cloud-platform-security

# Run security audit
./security-audit.sh --email security@example.com
```

### Network Security

To implement network security controls:

```bash
# Configure firewall rules
./iptables-rules.sh

# Setup intrusion prevention
cp fail2ban.local /etc/fail2ban/
cp -r fail2ban-filters/* /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/
systemctl restart fail2ban
```

### Web Server Security

To configure the web server with security best practices:

```bash
# Copy security configuration files to NGINX directory
cp nginx-hardening.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/
cp ssl-params.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/
cp security-headers.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/

# Setup ModSecurity WAF
./setup-modsecurity.sh

# Update ModSecurity rules
./update-modsecurity-rules.sh
```

## Security Layers

### 1. Application Security

- API security measures
- Authentication and authorization controls
- HTTP security headers
- Input validation and sanitization
- ModSecurity WAF implementation

### 2. Data Security

- Data access monitoring
- Database security controls
- Disk encryption for data at rest
- Secure backup procedures
- TLS encryption for data in transit

### 3. Infrastructure Security

- File integrity monitoring (AIDE)
- Host-based firewall configuration
- Regular security patching
- Secure boot configuration
- Server hardening based on CIS benchmarks

### 4. Monitoring and Response

- Centralized log collection
- Incident response procedures
- Real-time alerting
- Security audit trails
- Security event logging

### 5. Network Security

- DDoS protection
- Inbound traffic filtering
- Intrusion detection and prevention
- Network segmentation and isolation
- Outbound traffic control

## Security Testing

Regular security testing is performed using:

- Dependency vulnerability scanning with OWASP Dependency Check
- Infrastructure as Code scanning with tfsec
- Penetration testing by qualified security professionals
- Vulnerability scanning with OpenVAS/Nessus
- Web application scanning with OWASP ZAP

## Compliance

The security implementation helps maintain compliance with:

- GDPR
- HIPAA (where health data is involved)
- ISO 27001
- PCI DSS (where payment processing is involved)
- SOC 2 Type II

For detailed compliance information, refer to compliance.md.

## Best Practices

- Employee security awareness training
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement defense in depth
- Regular security assessments and testing
- Regular security patching and updates
- Security monitoring and incident response
