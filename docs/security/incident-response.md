# Security Incident Response Procedures

This document outlines the procedures for responding to security incidents affecting the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

## Incident Response Framework

The incident response framework for the Cloud Infrastructure Platform follows the NIST SP 800-61 (Computer Security Incident Handling Guide) methodology, consisting of four phases:

1. **Preparation**
2. **Detection and Analysis**
3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**
4. **Post-Incident Activity**

## Incident Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Incidents that have a severe impact on business operations, data confidentiality, or system integrity. Immediate action required. | Immediate response, 24/7 | Data breach, ransomware attack, production system compromise |
| **High** | Incidents with significant potential impact requiring urgent attention. | Response within 4 hours | Targeted attacks, malware outbreaks, credential theft |
| **Medium** | Incidents affecting non-critical systems or with limited potential impact. | Response within 24 hours | Isolated policy violations, suspicious activities, minor vulnerabilities |
| **Low** | Minor incidents with minimal impact requiring standard procedures. | Response within 72 hours | Low-risk vulnerabilities, isolated unauthorized access attempts |

## Incident Response Team

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| **Incident Response Manager** | Coordinates response activities, communicates with leadership, makes critical decisions |
| **Security Analyst** | Detects and analyzes incidents, implements technical countermeasures |
| **System Administrator** | Provides system access and information, implements technical controls |
| **Network Engineer** | Implements network-level controls, provides network forensics |
| **Legal Counsel** | Advises on legal implications, handles regulatory notifications |
| **Communications/PR** | Manages internal and external communications |

## Response Procedures

#### Analysis and Investigation

1. **Forensic Analysis**
   * Malware analysis if applicable
   * Root cause determination
   * Compromise timeline reconstruction
   * Damage assessment
   * Identification of all affected systems

2. **Threat Actor Assessment**
   * Tactics, techniques, and procedures
   * Attribution if possible
   * Indicators of compromise
   * Targeting strategy analysis

#### Eradication

1. **Removal of Attack Components**
   * Delete malware and unauthorized software
   * Remove unauthorized accounts
   * Eliminate persistence mechanisms
   * Address identified vulnerabilities

2. **Security Hardening**
   * Apply emergency patches
   * Update security configurations
   * Implement additional security controls
   * Address identified security gaps

#### Recovery

1. **Service Restoration**
   * Restore systems from clean backups when necessary
   * Rebuild compromised systems
   * Restore normal operations in phases
   * Implement enhanced monitoring

2. **Verification**
