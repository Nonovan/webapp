## Architecture & Design

The security architecture follows a layered approach:

1. **Application Security**: Secure development and application protection
2. **Cloud Infrastructure Security**: Platform security controls
3. **Data Security**: Protection of data at rest and in transit
4. **Identity & Access Management**: Authentication and authorization
5. **Network Security**: Perimeter protection and traffic controls
6. **Security Operations**: Monitoring, incident response, and governance

For comprehensive details, see security-architecture-overview.md.

## Compliance

The security implementation supports compliance with multiple frameworks:

- **CIS**: Center for Internet Security benchmarks
- **FedRAMP**: Federal security controls for cloud systems
- **GDPR**: Privacy and data protection requirements
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data security requirements
- **ISO 27001**: International information security standard
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Security control framework
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry security standard
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Trust service criteria compliance

For detailed compliance implementation, see compliance.md.

## Configuration

Standard security configurations include:

- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege implementation
- **Cryptography**: Standards for encryption and key management
- **Firewall Rules**: Network security policy configurations
- **Hardening Guidelines**: Server and application security hardening
- **MFA Setup**: Multi-factor authentication configuration
- **Monitoring**: Security event monitoring configuration
- **WAF Rules**: Web application firewall configuration

For implementation details, refer to hardening-checklist.md and firewall-policies.md.
