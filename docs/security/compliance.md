## Compliance Framework Overview

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform is designed to meet multiple compliance frameworks. This document provides guidance on how our security controls map to various regulatory and industry requirements.

## Audit Preparation

### Regular Activities

1. **Control Testing**: Regular validation of control effectiveness
2. **Documentation Review**: Ensuring all policies and procedures are current
3. **Evidence Collection**: Ongoing collection and organization of control evidence
4. **Mock Audits**: Internal exercises to prepare for external assessments

### Audit Response Process

1. **Audit Notification**: Receipt and acknowledgment of audit notice
2. **Audit Facilitation**: Supporting auditors during the assessment
3. **Certification Maintenance**: Ensuring continued compliance
4. **Evidence Gathering**: Compilation of required evidence using gather-evidence.sh
5. **Finding Remediation**: Addressing any identified issues
6. **SME Preparation**: Briefing of subject matter experts

## Compliance Resources

- Automated compliance reports available through the admin portal
- Compliance documentation is stored in `docs/security/compliance/`
- Control implementation evidence is organized by framework
- Questions about compliance should be directed to [compliance@example.com](mailto:compliance@example.com)

## FedRAMP (Moderate)

For government clients, our FedRAMP Moderate controls include:

- Annual third-party assessment
- Continuous monitoring that meets federal requirements
- Enhanced documentation for security controls
- More restrictive access management

## GDPR

### Key Implementation Areas

- **Data Breach Notification Process**: Integrated with incident response procedures
- **Data Protection Impact Assessments**: Templates in `docs/legal/dpia-template.md`
- **Data Subject Rights**: Implementation in `core/privacy/` modules
- **Lawful Basis for Processing**: Documented in `docs/legal/data-processing-register.md`
- **Privacy by Design**: Architecture review process ensures privacy considerations
- **Records of Processing Activities**: Maintained in centralized data register

## HIPAA (Where Applicable)

For healthcare-related applications:

- Additional security measures for healthcare data
- Business Associate Agreements with all relevant parties
- PHI encryption and access logging

## ISO 27001

### ISO 27001 Overview

ISO 27001 is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). It provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information.

### Annual Certification Process

1. **External Audit**: Engage certified ISO 27001 auditors for formal assessment
   - Deliverable: Audit results and certification renewal
   - Owner: CISO/Security Director
   - Schedule: Q3 each year

2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify any gaps between current implementation and ISO requirements
   - Deliverable: Gap analysis report with prioritized actions
   - Owner: Compliance Manager
   - Schedule: Q2 each year

3. **Internal Audit**: Conduct internal assessment of all ISO 27001 controls
   - Deliverable: Internal audit report with findings and remediation plan
   - Owner: Security Team
   - Schedule: Q1 each year

4. **Management Review**: Executive review of ISMS effectiveness
   - Deliverable: Management review minutes and improvement directives
   - Owner: Executive Leadership
   - Schedule: Q4 each year

5. **Remediation**: Address any identified gaps or non-conformities
   - Deliverable: Documented evidence of remediation
   - Owner: Respective department heads
   - Schedule: Q2-Q3 each year
