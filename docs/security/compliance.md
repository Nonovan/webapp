# Compliance Requirements and Documentation

This document outlines the compliance requirements and implementation details for the Cloud Infrastructure Platform security controls.

## Compliance Framework Overview

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform is designed to meet multiple compliance frameworks. This document provides guidance on how our security controls map to various regulatory and industry requirements.

## ISO 27001

### Overview

ISO 27001 is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). It provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information.

### Key Requirements and Implementations

| **Organization of Information Security** | Defined security roles and responsibilities | Security responsibilities documented in `docs/security/roles.md` with clear ownership |
| **Human Resource Security** | Security awareness training, screening | Mandatory security training program, background checks for all employees |
| **Asset Management** | Inventory and classification of information assets | Asset management system with data classification guidelines |
| **Access Control** | User access management, responsibilities | Role-based access control implemented in all systems with quarterly reviews |
| **Cryptography** | Controls for cryptographic keys | Key management procedures in `docs/security/crypto-standards.md` |
| **Physical Security** | Secure areas, equipment security | Physical security controls for all data centers and offices |
| **Operations Security** | Documented procedures, malware protection | Operational procedures, automated malware protection, logging |
| **Communications Security** | Network security, information transfer | Network security controls defined in `deployment/security/firewall-policies.md` |
| **System Acquisition** | Security requirements for information systems | Security requirements included in all vendor assessments |
| **Supplier Relationships** | Security in supplier agreements | Vendor security assessment process, contract requirements |
| **Incident Management** | Management of security incidents | Incident response procedures defined in `docs/admin/security_incident_response.md` |
| **Business Continuity** | Information security in business continuity | Disaster recovery and business continuity plans in `docs/deployment/disaster-recovery.md` |
| **Compliance** | Legal, regulatory compliance | Regular compliance assessments and audits |

3. **Remediation**: Address any identified gaps or non-conformities
   - Schedule: Q2-Q3 each year
   - Owner: Respective department heads
   - Deliverable: Documented evidence of remediation

4. **External Audit**: Engage certified ISO 27001 auditors for formal assessment

## SOC 2 Type II

### Overview

SOC 2 is a framework for managing data based on five "trust service criteria" â€” security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.

### Trust Service Categories Implementation

| Category | Implementation | Evidence Location |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Security** | Network security controls, vulnerability management, incident response | `deployment/security/` directory |
| **Availability** | High availability architecture, DR procedures, backup processes | `deployment/infrastructure/ha-config/` |
| **Processing Integrity** | Data validation, error handling, quality assurance | `core/validation/` modules |
| **Confidentiality** | Encryption, access controls, data classification | `deployment/security/data-protection/` |
| **Privacy** | Privacy policies, consent management, data subject rights | `docs/legal/privacy-procedures.md` |

### Compliance Maintenance

#### Continuous Monitoring

- Automated compliance monitoring through the security dashboard
- Weekly compliance status reports generated by `scripts/compliance/generate-report.sh`
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline for continuous control validation

#### Responsibility Matrix

Each compliance requirement has a designated owner responsible for:
- Maintaining control effectiveness
- Documenting evidence
- Responding to audit requests
- Implementing improvements
