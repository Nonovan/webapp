## Overview

The security update policy establishes a standardized approach for applying security updates across all components of the Cloud Infrastructure Platform. It ensures timely remediation of security vulnerabilities while maintaining system stability and minimizing disruption to services. This policy applies to all operating systems, applications, libraries, firmware, and network devices used within the platform's infrastructure.

## Key Components

- **Classification System**: Framework for categorizing updates by criticality and risk
  - Critical, high, medium, and low severity categories
  - Deployment timeframe requirements
  - Risk assessment guidelines
  - Update prioritization methodology

- **Deployment Processes**: Procedures for applying security updates
  - Environment-specific deployment workflows
  - Progressive deployment strategies
  - Update verification procedures
  - Service impact minimization techniques

- **Testing Framework**: Requirements for validating updates before deployment
  - Automated regression testing
  - Compatibility verification
  - Environment-specific requirements
  - Performance impact assessment
  - Verification procedures

- **Emergency Procedures**: Expedited processes for critical updates
  - Approval fast-tracking
  - Emergency deployment requirements
  - Incident response integration
  - Notification procedures

## Classifications

Security updates are classified according to the following severity levels:

| Severity | Definition | Deployment Timeframe |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| **Critical** | Vulnerabilities that pose an immediate threat with high likelihood of exploitation and significant impact. Examples include remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems, zero-day exploits with active attacks. | Within 24 hours |
| **High** | Significant vulnerabilities with potential for substantial damage but lower likelihood of immediate exploitation. Examples include escalation of privilege vulnerabilities, severe denial of service vulnerabilities. | Within 7 days |
| **Medium** | Vulnerabilities that are important but have mitigating factors such as complicated exploitation, limited damage potential, or low likelihood of exploitation. | Within 30 days |
| **Low** | Minor vulnerabilities with minimal risk to system security or stability. | During next maintenance window |

## Update Sources

### Authorized Sources

Security updates must be obtained only from authorized sources:

1. **Operating System Vendors**
   - Official repositories for Ubuntu, RHEL, etc.
   - Signed packages with validated checksums
   - Vendor's security advisories

2. **Application Providers**
   - Official application repositories
   - Vendor release channels
   - Verified developer sources

3. **Third-Party Repositories**
   - Only approved and verified repositories
   - Packages validated against signatures
   - Repositories with security policies aligned with organizational requirements

4. **Internal Package Repositories**
   - Internally validated packages
   - Centralized distribution for consistency
   - Version-controlled updates

### Source Validation

Before deployment, all updates must be validated:

- Verify digital signatures and checksums
- Confirm update comes from authentic source
- Validate against vulnerability advisories
- Check for security notices or recalls

## Testing Requirements

Security updates must undergo appropriate testing based on severity and risk:

### Critical Updates

- **Minimal Testing**: Due to urgency, testing focuses on core functionality
- **Required Tests**: Authentication, authorization, critical business functions
- **Deployment Strategy**: Deploy to 10% of non-production, validate, then deploy to all environments

### High Severity Updates

- **Standard Testing**: Complete testing in non-production environment
- **Required Tests**: Core functionality tests, regression tests, performance impact assessment
- **Deployment Strategy**: Staged deployment with validation at each step

### Medium/Low Severity Updates

- **Complete Testing**: Full test suite in non-production environment
- **Required Tests**: Functionality, regression, performance, integration, security
- **Deployment Strategy**: Standard deployment process through all environments

### Testing Environments

1. **Development**: Initial testing to verify basic functionality
2. **Integration**: Testing with integrated components
3. **Staging**: Production-like environment for final verification
4. **Canary**: Limited production deployment (if available)
5. **Production**: Full deployment with validation

## Deployment Procedures

### Deployment Tools

Security updates are deployed using the following authorized tools:

- **`apply_security_updates.sh`**: Primary update script for Linux systems
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible/Puppet for consistent deployment
- **Container Updates**: CI/CD pipeline for container image rebuilds
- **OS Updates**: Operating system-specific update tools

### Progressive Deployment Strategy

Unless otherwise required by update severity, updates follow this progression:

1. 10% of development environment
2. Full development environment
3. Staging environment
4. 10% of production environment (canary)
5. 50% of production environment
6. Complete production environment

## Maintenance Windows

Regular maintenance windows are scheduled for routine security updates:
