## Network Security Architecture

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform employs a multi-layered network security approach:

1. **Perimeter Layer**
   - External firewalls
   - DDoS protection services
   - Edge routers with ACLs
   - Traffic anomaly detection

2. **DMZ Layer**
   - Web application firewalls (WAF)
   - Load balancers
   - Public-facing services
   - TLS termination

3. **Application Layer**
   - Internal firewalls
   - Application security groups
   - Micro-segmentation
   - Service mesh controls

4. **Database Layer**
   - Database firewalls
   - Data access controls
   - Encryption gateways
   - Query filtering

5. **Management Layer**
   - Bastion hosts
   - Jump servers
   - Administrative networks
   - Privileged access workstations (PAWs)

## Firewall Policy Principles

### Core Principles

1. **Default Deny**
   - All traffic is denied by default
   - Explicit allow for required traffic only
   - Implicit deny at the end of access control lists

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple control points
   - No single point of failure
   - Overlapping protection mechanisms
   - Continuous validation

3. **Least Privilege**
   - Allow only necessary access
   - Minimize scope of allowed communications
   - Time-bound access when possible

## Standard Firewall Rules

### External Firewall Rules

| Source | Destination | Port/Protocol | Purpose | Environment |
|--------|-------------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Any | Load Balancers | 80/TCP (HTTP) | Redirect to HTTPS | All |
| Any | Load Balancers | 443/TCP (HTTPS) | Web Application Access | All |
| Authorized IPs | Bastion Hosts | 22/TCP (SSH) | Administrative Access | All |
| CDN Providers | Web Servers | 443/TCP (HTTPS) | Content Delivery | Production, Staging |
| Monitoring Systems | All Systems | ICMP Type 8 | Availability Monitoring | All |

### Internal Firewall Rules

| Source | Destination | Port/Protocol | Purpose | Environment |
|--------|-------------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Application Servers | Cache Servers | 6379/TCP (Redis) | Cache Operations | All |
| Application Servers | Database Servers | 5432/TCP (PostgreSQL) | Database Access | All |
| Bastion Hosts | All Systems | 22/TCP (SSH) | Administrative Access | All |
| Log Collection | All Systems | 514/UDP | Syslog | All |
| Monitoring Servers | All Systems | 9100/TCP | Metrics Collection | All |
| Web Servers | Application Servers | 8080/TCP | API Requests | All |

## Zone-Based Firewall Policy

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform uses zone-based firewall policies to control traffic between different network segments:

1. **Internet Zone**
   - Contains external-facing resources
   - Limited inbound access
   - Heavily restricted outbound access

2. **Web Zone**
   - Contains web servers and load balancers
   - Accepts connections from the Internet zone on ports 80/443
   - Initiates connections to the Application zone

3. **Application Zone**
   - Contains application servers
   - Accepts connections from the Web zone
   - Initiates connections to the Database zone

4. **Database Zone**
   - Contains database servers
   - Accepts connections from the Application zone only
   - No initiated outbound connections to other zones

5. **Management Zone**
   - Contains administrative systems
   - Controlled access to all other zones
   - Strict authentication and authorization

## Firewall Implementation

### Cloud Provider Firewalls

For infrastructure hosted in cloud environments:

1. **AWS**
   - Security Groups for instance-level firewall rules
   - Network ACLs for subnet-level controls
   - AWS WAF for web application protection
   - AWS Shield for DDoS protection

2. **Azure**
   - Network Security Groups (NSGs) for VM and subnet level rules
   - Azure Firewall for centralized control
   - Azure Front Door with WAF for web application protection
   - DDoS Protection Standard for DDoS mitigation

3. **Google Cloud Platform**
   - VPC Firewall Rules for network-level control
   - Cloud Armor for web application protection
   - Cloud Load Balancing with security policies

### On-Premises Firewalls

For on-premises infrastructure components:

1. **Perimeter Firewalls**
   - Stateful packet inspection
   - IPS/IDS capabilities
   - VPN termination
   - High availability configuration

2. **Internal Firewalls**
   - Segment different network zones
   - Control east-west traffic
   - Application-aware filtering
   - Deep packet inspection where required

## Firewall Change Management

All firewall changes must follow the established change management process:

1. **Request**
   - Business justification
   - Duration (temporary or permanent)
   - Source and destination information
   - Required ports and protocols

2. **Review**
   - Security team assessment
   - Compliance verification
   - Architecture review
   - Risk analysis

3. **Approval**
   - Security manager approval for standard changes
   - Security committee approval for high-risk changes
   - Emergency change process for critical situations

4. **Implementation**
   - Change implementation in test environment
   - Verification of rule effectiveness
   - Implementation in production
   - Documentation update

5. **Audit**
   - Regular review of firewall rules
   - Removal of obsolete rules
   - Compliance verification
   - Optimization of ruleset

## Monitoring and Logging

All firewall events must be logged and monitored:

1. **Required Logging**
   - Administrative access
   - Configuration changes
   - Connection accept/deny events
   - System health and status

2. **Log Retention**
   - Access controls on log repositories
   - Minimum 90 days online storage
   - Tamper-evident storage
   - 1 year archive storage

3. **Monitoring**
   - Automated analysis for anomalies
   - Correlation with other security events
   - Dashboard visibility for security operations
   - Real-time alerting for critical events

## Compliance Requirements

Firewall configurations must comply with the following standards:

1. **Internal Standards**
   - Annual firewall rule review
   - Automated compliance checking
   - Quarterly firewall change audit

2. **ISO 27001**
   - A.13.1: Network security management
   - Controls for securing network services

3. **NIST SP 800-41**
   - Best practices for configuration and maintenance
   - Guidelines on firewalls and firewall policy

4. **PCI DSS**
   - Regular testing and validation of firewall rules
   - Requirement 1: Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data
