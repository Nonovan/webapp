# Firewall Policies and Configuration

This document outlines the firewall policies and configuration standards for the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

## Network Security Architecture

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform employs a multi-layered network security approach:

1. **Perimeter Layer**
   * External firewalls
   * DDoS protection services
   * Edge routers with ACLs
   * Traffic anomaly detection

2. **DMZ Layer**
   * Web application firewalls (WAF)
   * Load balancers
   * Public-facing services
   * TLS termination

3. **Application Layer**
   * Internal firewalls
   * Application security groups
   * Micro-segmentation
   * Service mesh controls

4. **Database Layer**
   * Database firewalls
   * Data access controls
   * Encryption gateways
   * Query filtering

5. **Management Layer**
   * Bastion hosts
   * Jump servers
   * Administrative networks
   * Privileged access workstations (PAWs)

## Firewall Policy Principles

### Core Principles

1. **Default Deny**
   * All traffic is denied by default
   * Explicit allow for required traffic only
   * Implicit deny at the end of access control lists

2. **Least Privilege**
   * Allow only necessary access
   * Minimize scope of allowed communications
   * Time-bound access when possible

3. **Defense in Depth**
   * Multiple control points
   * Overlapping protection mechanisms
   * No single point of failure
   * Continuous validation

## Standard Firewall Rules

### External Firewall Rules

| Source | Destination | Port/Protocol | Purpose | Environment |
|--------|-------------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Any | Load Balancers | 80/TCP (HTTP) | Redirect to HTTPS | All |
| Any | Load Balancers | 443/TCP (HTTPS) | Web Application Access | All |
| Authorized IPs | Bastion Hosts | 22/TCP (SSH) | Administrative Access | All |
| Monitoring Systems | All Systems | ICMP Type 8 | Availability Monitoring | All |
| CDN Providers | Web Servers | 443/TCP (HTTPS) | Content Delivery | Production, Staging |

### Internal Firewall Rules

| Source | Destination | Port/Protocol | Purpose | Environment |
|--------|-------------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Web Servers | Application Servers | 8080/TCP | API Requests | All |
| Application Servers | Database Servers | 5432/TCP (PostgreSQL) | Database Access | All |
| Application Servers | Cache Servers | 6379/TCP (Redis) | Cache Operations | All |
| Monitoring Servers | All Systems | 9100/TCP | Metrics Collection | All |
| Log Collection | All Systems | 514/UDP | Syslog | All |
| Bastion Hosts | All Systems | 22/TCP (SSH) | Administrative Access | All |

## Zone-Based Firewall Policy

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform uses zone-based firewall policies to control traffic between different network segments:

1. **Internet Zone**
   * Contains external-facing resources
   * Limited inbound access
   * Heavily restricted outbound access

2. **Web Zone**
   * Contains web servers and load balancers
   * Accepts connections from the Internet zone on ports 80/443
   * Initiates connections to the Application zone

3. **Application Zone**
   * Contains application servers
   * Accepts connections from the Web zone
   * Initiates connections to the Database zone

4. **Database Zone**
   * Contains database servers
   * Accepts connections from the Application zone only
   * No initiated outbound connections to other zones

5. **Management Zone**
   * Contains administrative systems
   * Controlled access to all other zones
   * Strict authentication and authorization

## Firewall Implementation

### Cloud Provider Firewalls

For infrastructure hosted in cloud environments:

1. **AWS**
   * Security Groups for instance-level firewall rules
   * Network ACLs for subnet-level controls
   * AWS WAF for web application protection
   * AWS Shield for DDoS protection

2. **Azure**
   * Network Security Groups (NSGs) for VM and subnet level rules
   * Azure Firewall for centralized control
   * Azure Front Door with WAF for web application protection
   * DDoS Protection Standard for DDoS mitigation

3. **Google Cloud Platform**
   * VPC Firewall Rules for network-level control
   * Cloud Armor for web application protection
   * Cloud Load Balancing with security policies

### On-Premises Firewalls

For on-premises infrastructure components:

1. **Perimeter Firewalls**
   * Stateful packet inspection
   * IPS/IDS capabilities
   * VPN termination
   * High availability configuration

2. **Internal Firewalls**
   * Segment different network zones
   * Control east-west traffic
   * Application-aware filtering
   * Deep packet inspection where required

## Firewall Change Management

All firewall changes must follow the established change management process:

1. **Request**
   * Business justification
   * Duration (temporary or permanent)
   * Source and destination information
   * Required ports and protocols

2. **Review**
   * Security team assessment
   * Compliance verification
   * Architecture review
   * Risk analysis

3. **Approval**
   * Security manager approval for standard changes
   * Security committee approval for high-risk changes
   * Emergency change process for critical situations

4. **Implementation**
   * Change implementation in test environment
   * Verification of rule effectiveness
   * Implementation in production
   * Documentation update

5. **Audit**
   * Regular review of firewall rules
   * Removal of obsolete rules
   * Compliance verification
   * Optimization of ruleset

## Monitoring and Logging

All firewall events must be logged and monitored:

1. **Required Logging**
   * Connection accept/deny events
   * Configuration changes
   * Administrative access
   * System health and status

2. **Log Retention**
   * Minimum 90 days online storage
   * 1 year archive storage
   * Tamper-evident storage
   * Access controls on log repositories

3. **Monitoring**
   * Real-time alerting for critical events
   * Correlation with other security events
   * Automated analysis for anomalies
   * Dashboard visibility for security operations

## Compliance Requirements

Firewall configurations must comply with the following standards:

1. **PCI DSS**
   * Requirement 1: Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data
   * Regular testing and validation of firewall rules

2. **ISO 27001**
   * A.13.1: Network security management
   * Controls for securing network services

3. **NIST SP 800-41**
   * Guidelines on firewalls and firewall policy
   * Best practices for configuration and maintenance

4. **Internal Standards**
   * Annual firewall rule review
   * Quarterly firewall change audit
   * Automated compliance checking
