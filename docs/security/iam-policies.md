## Overview

The Identity and Access Management policies establish a comprehensive framework for controlling user authentication, authorization, and access across the Cloud Infrastructure Platform. These policies implement the principles of least privilege, defense in depth, and separation of duties to protect resources from unauthorized access while providing appropriate access to legitimate users.

## Key Components

- **Authentication Framework**: Multi-factor and multi-context authentication
  - Adaptive authentication mechanisms
  - Certificate-based authentication for services
  - Multi-factor authentication requirements
  - Password policy and management
  - Token-based authentication flows

- **Authorization Model**: Granular, attribute-based access control
  - Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
  - Context-aware authorization
  - Just-in-time access provisioning
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Service-to-service authentication

- **Identity Governance**: Centralized identity management
  - Access certification and reviews
  - Identity lifecycle management
  - Policy enforcement points
  - Privileged access management
  - User provisioning and deprovisioning

- **IAM Security Controls**: Enhanced security measures
  - Conditional access policies
  - Identity threat detection
  - Login monitoring and alerting
  - Session management
  - User behavior analytics

## Access Control Models

The platform implements a hybrid access control model combining:

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC provides coarse-grained access control through pre-defined roles:

| Role | Description | Default Permissions |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Administrator | Platform-wide administrative access | Full access to all resources and management capabilities |
| Auditor | Read-only access for compliance and security review | Read-only access to logs, configurations, and security settings |
| Developer | Resource creation and management | Access to development resources with limited administrative capabilities |
| Operator | Day-to-day operational tasks | Operation-focused access without configuration change capabilities |
| Security Officer | Security management and monitoring | Access to security controls, logs, and security configurations |
| User | Basic platform usage | Limited access to assigned resources only |

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

ABAC extends RBAC with dynamic, fine-grained controls based on:

- **Subject Attributes**: User properties, department, clearance level
- **Resource Attributes**: Classification, owner, sensitivity
- **Action Attributes**: Read, write, delete, execute
- **Context Attributes**: Time, location, device, network

### Just-In-Time (JIT) Access

Privileged access is provided on a temporary, just-in-time basis:

1. User requests elevated access with justification
2. Approval workflow is triggered
3. Time-limited elevated permissions are granted
4. Actions are logged for audit purposes
5. Permissions are automatically revoked after expiration

## Authentication Policies

### Password Policy

- Minimum length: 12 characters
- Complexity: Must contain characters from at least three of the following categories:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Password history: 24 previous passwords remembered
- Maximum age: 90 days
- Account lockout: 5 failed attempts
- Lockout duration: 30 minutes

### Multi-Factor Authentication

MFA is required for:

1. **All administrative access**
2. **Access to production environments**
3. **Access to sensitive data**
4. **Remote access to systems**

Supported MFA methods:

- TOTP-based authenticator apps (preferred)
- Hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
- SMS codes (discouraged, only as fallback)

### Session Management

- Session timeout: 15 minutes of inactivity for administrative sessions
- Session timeout: 4 hours of inactivity for regular sessions
- Maximum session duration: 12 hours
- Concurrent session limit: 5 sessions per user
- Session binding to IP address and device fingerprint

## Authorization Framework

### Permission Structure

Permissions follow a hierarchical structure:

```plaintext
service:resource:action
```

Examples:

- `cloud:instance:create`
- `storage:bucket:read`
- `iam:user:delete`

### Policy Definition

Policies are defined using JSON syntax:

```json
{
  "Version": "2023-10-01",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloud:instance:read",
        "cloud:instance:start",
        "cloud:instance:stop"
      ],
      "Resource": "cloud:instance:*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "cloud:instance:owner": "${user.id}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Inheritance and Precedence

1. Explicit deny overrides any allow
2. Resource-specific policies override resource-type policies
3. User-specific permissions override group permissions
4. More specific resource paths override less specific ones

## Roles and Permissions

### Predefined Roles

| Role | Permission Set | Use Case |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Admin | All actions on all resources | Platform administrators |
| CloudAdmin | All cloud resource actions | Cloud resource administrators |
| ResourceViewer | Read-only access to resources | Auditors, reporting users |
| SecurityAdmin | All security-related actions | Security team |
| UserAdmin | User management actions | User administrators |

### Custom Roles

Custom roles can be created with specific permission sets for specialized use cases. Custom roles must:

1. Follow the principle of least privilege
2. Be documented with clear purpose and scope
3. Be reviewed quarterly for continued necessity
4. Not duplicate existing predefined roles

## Privileged Access Management

### Privileged Account Types

1. **Emergency Access**: Break-glass accounts for emergency situations
2. **Service Accounts**: Used by automated systems and services
3. **Technical Accounts**: Used for administration and configuration
4. **User Admin Accounts**: Used for user management tasks

### Controls for Privileged Access

- **Access Approval**: Multi-party approval for privileged operations
- **Enhanced Authentication**: Hardware MFA required for privileged accounts
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Heightened logging for privileged actions
- **Just-in-Time Access**: Time-limited privileged access
- **Privileged Session Recording**: Session recording for administrative access

### Emergency Access Procedure

1. Request emergency access through the emergency access portal
2. Provide justification and expected duration
3. Approval by at least two authorized approvers
4. Time-limited credentials issued
5. All actions logged and reviewed post-incident
6. Detailed incident report required after emergency access use

## Lifecycle Management

### Provisioning

1. User identity created in central identity provider
2. Appropriate roles assigned based on job function
3. Required approvals obtained for privileged roles
4. Access review scheduled for new account

### Changes

1. Access change request submitted
2. Appropriate approvals obtained based on requested access level
3. Changes implemented and logged
4. User notified of completed changes

### Deprovisioning

1. Access termination request received (HR integration or manual request)
2. Immediate suspension of all access (within 1 hour)
3. Review of user's resources and reassignment if necessary
4. Complete removal of access rights (within 24 hours)
5. Archival of user data according to retention policy

   - Standard user accounts: Semi-annually

2. **Review Scope**
   - Account status and necessity
   - Group memberships and role assignments
   - Last login and activity
   - Privileges compared to job requirements

3. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Justification for continued access
   - Reviewer information and timestamp
   - Specific privileges reviewed and approved

### System Implementation

   - SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect federation
   - Group synchronization with HR systems
   - JIT access workflow implementation
   - MFA enforcement configuration

2. **Policy Management**
