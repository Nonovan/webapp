# Penetration Testing Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines and procedures for conducting penetration tests against the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

## Overview

Penetration testing is a critical component of our security assurance program, providing an objective assessment of our security controls by simulating real-world attack techniques. These guidelines ensure that penetration tests are conducted in a consistent, controlled, and effective manner.

- Discovery
- Attack
- Reporting

### MITRE ATT&CK Framework
Use the [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](<https://attack.mitre.org/>) to:
- Structure attack scenarios
- Ensure comprehensive technique coverage
- Map findings to known adversary tactics and techniques

## Testing Process

### 1. Pre-Engagement

- Identify critical systems requiring special handling
- Define excluded systems or techniques
- Establish emergency contacts

#### Authorization
- Obtain formal written authorization
- Document scope and approved testing activities
- Ensure legal clearance
- Confirm cloud provider notification requirements

### 2. Engagement Execution

#### Reconnaissance
- Passive information gathering
- Network and service discovery
- Application mapping
- Technology stack identification

#### Vulnerability Identification
- Automated scanning
- Manual testing
- Configuration review
- Code review (if in scope)

#### Exploitation
- Validate vulnerabilities through controlled exploitation
- Document successful attack paths
- Track compromised assets and access levels
- Document evidence (screenshots, data access logs)

#### Post-Exploitation
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Lateral movement
- Persistence establishment (if authorized)
- Data access attempts

#### Daily Check-ins
- Provide status updates to designated contact
- Report critical findings immediately
- Address any concerns or blockers

### 3. Post-Engagement

#### Reporting
- Executive summary for leadership
- Detailed technical findings
- Reproduction steps for each vulnerability
- Severity ratings using CVSS v3.1
- Recommended remediation actions
- Evidence and screenshots

#### Debriefing
- Present findings to stakeholders
- Discuss remediation strategies

- Provide clarification on findings

#### Remediation Support
- Assist with understanding vulnerability details
- Validate remediation effectiveness if requested
- Provide additional guidance as needed

## Rules of Engagement
