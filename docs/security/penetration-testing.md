# Penetration Testing Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines and procedures for conducting penetration tests against the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

## Overview

Penetration testing is a critical component of our security assurance program, providing an objective assessment of our security controls by simulating real-world attack techniques. These guidelines ensure that penetration tests are conducted in a consistent, controlled, and effective manner.

## Types of Penetration Tests

### 1. External Network Penetration Testing

**Scope**: Internet-facing infrastructure, including:
- Web applications
- API endpoints
- VPN endpoints
- Mail servers
- DNS servers
- Public cloud resources

**Frequency**: Quarterly

**Objectives**:
- Identify vulnerabilities in perimeter defenses
- Test effectiveness of network security controls
- Discover misconfigurations in public-facing services
- Assess potential for unauthorized access from the Internet

### 2. Internal Network Penetration Testing

**Scope**: Internal systems and networks, including:
- Internal servers and workstations
- Network devices
- Internal services and applications
- Active Directory/LDAP environments
- Network segmentation controls

**Frequency**: Semi-annually

**Objectives**:
- Evaluate lateral movement potential
- Test network segmentation effectiveness
- Identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities
- Assess internal privilege escalation opportunities

### 3. Web Application Penetration Testing

**Scope**: Web applications and APIs, including:
- Customer-facing applications
- Administrative interfaces
- REST/SOAP APIs
- Authentication mechanisms
- Session management
- Data validation and processing

**Frequency**: Quarterly and after significant changes

**Objectives**:
- Identify application security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Test business logic flaws
- Evaluate authentication and authorization controls
- Assess secure data handling practices

### 4. Cloud Infrastructure Penetration Testing

**Scope**: Cloud-based resources and services:
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) configurations
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) implementations
- Container orchestration platforms
- Storage services
- Identity and access management

**Frequency**: Quarterly

**Objectives**:
- Assess cloud configuration security
- Evaluate IAM policy implementation
- Test container escape scenarios
- Identify improper access controls
- Evaluate network security group configurations

### 5. Mobile Application Penetration Testing

**Scope**: iOS and Android applications:
- Client-side security controls
- API interactions
- Data storage practices
- Authentication mechanisms
- Binary protections

**Frequency**: Semi-annually and after major releases

**Objectives**:
- Identify client-side vulnerabilities
- Assess secure storage of sensitive data
- Test API communication security
- Evaluate certificate pinning implementation
- Assess resistance to reverse engineering

## Penetration Testing Methodology

### Pre-Engagement

1. **Scope Definition**
   - Clearly define testing boundaries
   - Identify critical systems and applications
   - Establish testing timeline and hours
   - Define acceptable testing techniques and tools

2. **Authorization**
   - Obtain written approval from system owners
   - Execute non-disclosure agreements with testing team
   - Prepare formal Rules of Engagement document
   - Ensure proper internal notifications

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate potential impact on production systems
   - Identify contingency measures for critical services
   - Establish communication channels for emergencies
   - Define clear escalation paths

### Testing Execution

1. **Reconnaissance**
   - Passive information gathering
   - Network and domain enumeration
   - Service identification
   - Architecture mapping

2. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Automated scanning with approved tools
   - Manual verification of findings
   - Configuration review
   - Code review (if in scope)

3. **Exploitation**
   - Controlled exploitation of discovered vulnerabilities
   - Privilege escalation attempts
   - Lateral movement testing
   - Data exfiltration simulation
   - Post-exploitation activities

4. **Documentation**
   - Real-time logging of all activities
   - Evidence collection with timestamps
   - Screenshot and video capture of significant findings
   - Maintaining chain of custody for discovered data

### Post-Engagement

1. **Reporting**
   - Executive summary for leadership
   - Technical findings with reproduction steps
   - Risk classification and prioritization
   - Remediation recommendations
   - Supporting evidence and references

2. **Debriefing**
   - Presentation of key findings
   - Technical walkthrough for security and development teams
   - Q&A session
   - Initial remediation planning

3. **Remediation Support**
   - Technical guidance for addressing findings
   - Validation of fixes
   - Follow-up testing

## Requirements for Testing Teams

### Internal Testing Teams

- Must be trained in ethical hacking techniques
- Must maintain relevant certifications (OSCP, CEH, GPEN, etc.)
- Must follow documented testing procedures
- Must maintain detailed activity logs
- Must respect scope boundaries and authorized activities

### External Testing Providers

- Must provide proof of professional liability insurance
- Must have relevant industry certifications
- Must sign non-disclosure agreements
- Must provide named testers with credentials
- Must commit to secure handling of findings
- Must comply with data retention and destruction policies

## Rules of Engagement

### Permissible Activities

- Passive reconnaissance
- Approved scanning activities
- Controlled exploitation
- Approved social engineering (if in scope)
- Documented penetration techniques

### Prohibited Activities

- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Destructive testing without explicit approval
- Exploitation of production data
- Testing outside of defined scope
- Unauthorized social engineering
- Testing outside of approved time windows

## Security and Safety Measures

### Test Data Handling

- Use synthetic or sanitized data whenever possible
- Encrypt any captured sensitive information
- Securely delete all data after engagement
- Document any inadvertent access to production data

### Communication

- Maintain open communication channel during testing
- Report critical vulnerabilities immediately
- Daily status updates during active testing
- Document all communication for future reference

### Emergency Procedures

- Contact emergency coordinator if production issues arise
- Be prepared to halt testing immediately if requested
- Have rollback procedures ready for all exploits
- Document any emergency incidents thoroughly

## Remediation Process

### Verification Testing
- Conduct retesting of vulnerabilities after remediation
- Provide verification reports
- Update vulnerability status

### Tracking
- All findings tracked in vulnerability management system
- Regular status updates on remediation progress
- Risk acceptance documentation for any exceptions

## Special Considerations

### Production Testing Safeguards
- Maintain documented rollback procedures
- Schedule testing during low-traffic periods when possible
- Notify monitoring teams before testing begins
- Use rate limiting for automated tools
- Restrict destructive testing to test environments

### Cloud Provider Requirements
- Review cloud provider penetration testing policies
- Submit required notifications to cloud providers
- Adhere to cloud provider restrictions
- Maintain documentation of cloud provider approvals

### Compliance Requirements
- Ensure testing meets relevant compliance requirements:
  - PCI DSS requires annual and post-change testing
  - HIPAA requires regular security evaluation
  - SOC 2 requires periodic penetration testing
  - GDPR requires regular testing of security controls
