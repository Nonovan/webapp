# Security Architecture Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the security architecture implemented in the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

## Security Design Principles

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform security architecture is built on the following core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**
   * Multiple security layers throughout the system
   * No single point of failure in security controls
   * Overlapping protection mechanisms

2. **Least Privilege**
   * All components operate with minimum necessary permissions
   * Just-in-time and just-enough access
   * Granular role-based access control (RBAC)

3. **Secure by Default**
   * Security controls enabled by default
   * Conservative security posture out of the box
   * Explicit opt-in for reduced security settings

4. **Fail Secure**
   * Systems default to secure state on failure
   * Explicit deny-by-default policies
   * Graceful security failure handling

5. **Economy of Mechanism**
   * Simple, well-understood security controls
   * Avoid security through obscurity
   * Leverage well-tested industry-standard components

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Network Security

The network security layer provides perimeter protection and network traffic controls:

* **External Firewalls**
  * Stateful packet inspection
  * IP-based access control lists
  * Protocol and port restrictions
  * DDoS mitigation capabilities

* **Internal Network Segmentation**
  * Separate network zones (DMZ, application, database)
  * Controlled traffic between zones
  * Micro-segmentation where appropriate
  * Zero-trust network architecture

* **Encryption in Transit**
  * TLS 1.2+ for all external connections
  * Mutual TLS for service-to-service communication
  * Perfect Forward Secrecy for key exchanges
  * Strong cipher suites with regular rotation

* **Network Monitoring**
  * Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
  * Network traffic analysis
  * Behavioral anomaly detection
  * Centralized log collection and analysis

### 2. Identity and Access Management

The IAM layer controls authentication, authorization, and access:

  * Attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained access
  * Just-in-time access provisioning
  * Privilege access management (PAM)

* **Service Identity**
  * Managed service accounts
  * Short-lived credentials
  * Automated rotation of service credentials
  * Service mesh identity management

* **Secrets Management**
  * Centralized secrets storage with encryption
  * Automated secret rotation
  * Access auditing for secrets
  * Integration with HSMs for critical secrets

### 3. Data Security

The data security layer protects sensitive information:

* **Encryption at Rest**
  * Full-disk encryption for all storage
  * Field-level encryption for sensitive data
  * Transparent database encryption
  * Encryption key management with proper key rotation

* **Data Loss Prevention**
  * Content inspection for sensitive data
  * Egress filtering at network boundaries
  * Watermarking of sensitive documents
  * Data classification and tagging

* **Data Integrity**
  * Digital signatures for critical data
  * Checksums for data validation
  * Secure audit trails for data changes
  * Version control for configuration data

* **Privacy Controls**
  * Data minimization techniques
  * Anonymization and pseudonymization
  * Consent management
  * Personal data inventory and mapping

### 4. Application Security

The application security layer ensures secure software development:

* **Security Development Lifecycle**
  * Secure coding standards
  * Static application security testing (SAST)
  * Dynamic application security testing (DAST)
  * Manual penetration testing

* **API Security**
  * OAuth 2.0 authorization
  * Rate limiting and throttling
  * Input validation and sanitization
  * API gateway with security controls

* **Web Application Security**
  * Web Application Firewall (WAF)
  * Content Security Policy (CSP)
  * Protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
  * Secure cookie configuration

* **Container Security**
  * Minimal base images
  * Image scanning for vulnerabilities
  * Runtime protection
  * Container isolation and resource limits

### 5. Cloud Infrastructure Security

The infrastructure security layer secures the underlying platform:

* **Secure Configuration**
  * Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with security scanning
  * Configuration management for drift detection
  * Hardened base images and templates
  * Compliance-as-code for automated validation

* **Resource Protection**
  * Cloud service provider security features
  * Service endpoint protection
  * Resource tagging and inventory management
  * Secure bastion access for administrative functions

* **Vulnerability Management**
  * Automated security scans
  * Patch management processes
  * Security health dashboards
  * Continuous vulnerability assessment

* **Disaster Recovery**
  * Multi-region/zone deployment
  * Regular backup and recovery testing
  * Secure offsite backups
  * Infrastructure integrity verification

### 6. Security Operations

The security operations layer manages ongoing security activities:

* **Monitoring and Detection**
  * Security information and event management (SIEM)
  * User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)
  * Threat intelligence integration
  * 24/7 security monitoring

* **Incident Response**
  * Defined incident response procedures
  * Automated response workflows
  * Forensic investigation capabilities
  * Regular tabletop exercises

* **Compliance Management**
  * Automated compliance reporting
  * Evidence collection for audits
  * Continuous compliance monitoring
  * Regulatory change tracking

* **Security Awareness**
  * Regular security training
  * Phishing simulations
  * Security champions program
  * Executive-level security reporting
