## Security Design Principles

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform security architecture is built on the following core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple security layers throughout the system
   - No single point of failure in security controls
   - Overlapping protection mechanisms

2. **Economy of Mechanism**
   - Avoid security through obscurity
   - Leverage well-tested industry-standard components
   - Simple, well-understood security controls

3. **Fail Secure**
   - Explicit deny-by-default policies
   - Graceful security failure handling
   - Systems default to secure state on failure

4. **Least Privilege**
   - All components operate with minimum necessary permissions
   - Granular role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Just-in-time and just-enough access

5. **Secure by Default**
   - Conservative security posture out of the box
   - Explicit opt-in for reduced security settings
   - Security controls enabled by default

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Application Security

The application security layer ensures secure software development:

- **API Security**
  - API gateway with security controls
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - OAuth 2.0 authorization
  - Rate limiting and throttling

  - Content inspection for sensitive data
  - Data classification and tagging
  - Egress filtering at network boundaries
  - Watermarking of sensitive documents

- **Encryption at Rest**
  - Encryption key management with proper key rotation
  - Field-level encryption for sensitive data
  - Full-disk encryption for all storage
  - Transparent database encryption

- **Privacy Controls**
  - Anonymization and pseudonymization
  - Consent management
  - Data minimization techniques
  - Personal data inventory and mapping

### 4. Identity and Access Management

The IAM layer controls authentication, authorization, and access:

- **Authentication**
  - Certificate-based authentication for services
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all admin access
  - OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for federated identity
  - Password policies with complexity requirements

- **Authorization**
  - Attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained access
  - Just-in-time access provisioning
  - Privilege access management (PAM)
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)

- **Secrets Management**
  - Access auditing for secrets
  - Automated secret rotation
  - Centralized secrets storage with encryption
  - Integration with HSMs for critical secrets

- **Service Identity**
  - Automated rotation of service credentials
  - Managed service accounts
  - Service mesh identity management
  - Short-lived credentials

### 5. Network Security

The network security layer provides perimeter protection and network traffic controls:

- **Encryption in Transit**
  - Mutual TLS for service-to-service communication
  - Perfect Forward Secrecy for key exchanges
  - Strong cipher suites with regular rotation
  - TLS 1.2+ for all external connections

- **External Firewalls**
  - DDoS mitigation capabilities
  - IP-based access control lists
  - Protocol and port restrictions
  - Stateful packet inspection

- **Internal Network Segmentation**
  - Controlled traffic between zones
  - Micro-segmentation where appropriate
  - Separate network zones (DMZ, application, database)
  - Zero-trust network architecture

- **Network Monitoring**
  - Behavioral anomaly detection
  - Centralized log collection and analysis
  - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
  - Network traffic analysis

### 6. Security Operations

The security operations layer manages ongoing security activities:

- **Compliance Management**
  - Automated compliance reporting
  - Continuous compliance monitoring
  - Evidence collection for audits
  - Regulatory change tracking

- **Incident Response**
  - Automated response workflows
  - Defined incident response procedures
  - Forensic investigation capabilities
  - Regular tabletop exercises

- **Monitoring and Detection**
  - 24/7 security monitoring
  - Security information and event management (SIEM)
  - Threat intelligence integration
  - User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)

- **Security Awareness**
  - Executive-level security reporting
  - Phishing simulations
  - Regular security training
  - Security champions program
