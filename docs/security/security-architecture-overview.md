# Security Architecture Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the security architecture implemented in the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

## Security Design Principles

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform security architecture is built on the following core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**
   * Multiple security layers throughout the system
   * No single point of failure in security controls
   * Overlapping protection mechanisms

2. **Least Privilege**
   * All components operate with minimum necessary permissions
   * Just-in-time and just-enough access
   * Granular role-based access control (RBAC)

3. **Secure by Default**
   * Security controls enabled by default
   * Conservative security posture out of the box
   * Explicit opt-in for reduced security settings

4. **Fail Secure**
   * Systems default to secure state on failure
   * Explicit deny-by-default policies
   * Graceful security failure handling

5. **Economy of Mechanism**
   * Simple, well-understood security controls
   * Avoid security through obscurity
   * Leverage well-tested industry-standard components

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Network Security

The network security layer provides perimeter protection and network traffic controls:

* **External Firewalls**
  * Stateful packet inspection
  * IP-based access control lists
  * Protocol and port restrictions
  * DDoS mitigation capabilities

* **Internal Network Segmentation**
  * Separate network zones (DMZ, application, database)
  * Controlled traffic between zones
  * Micro-segmentation where appropriate
  * Private networking for internal systems

* **Traffic Encryption**
  * TLS 1.2/1.3 for external connections
  * VPN for remote administrative access
  * Encrypted internal communication where applicable
  * Certificate-based authentication

### 2. Host Security

Host-level security controls protect the operating system and server infrastructure:

* **OS Hardening**
  * Minimal installation profile
  * Regular security patching
  * Disabled unnecessary services
  * File system access controls

* **Host-based Firewalls**
  * iptables with restrictive rules
  * Connection rate limiting
  * Application-specific allow lists
  * Explicit deny-all default policy

* **Integrity Monitoring**
  * AIDE file integrity verification
  * System binary verification
  * Runtime application self-protection
  * Immutable infrastructure principles

* **Endpoint Protection**
  * Malware prevention
  * Behavioral monitoring
  * Exploit protection
  * Host-based intrusion detection

### 3. Application Security

Application security controls protect the platform's application layer:

* **Web Application Firewall**
  * ModSecurity with OWASP Core Rule Set
  * Custom application-specific rules
  * API request filtering and validation
  * Bot protection mechanisms

* **Secure Development Practices**
  * Secure coding standards
  * Regular security testing
  * Dependency vulnerability scanning
  * Code signing and verification

* **Runtime Protection**
  * Input validation and sanitization
  * Output encoding
  * SQL injection prevention
  * Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
  * Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection

* **Authentication and Authorization**
  * Multi-factor authentication
  * Strong password policies
  * Session security controls
  * JWT-based API authentication
  * Granular role-based authorization

### 4. Data Security

Data security controls protect sensitive information at rest and in transit:

* **Encryption**
  * TLS for all data in transit
  * Transparent data encryption at rest
  * Key management system
  * Database column-level encryption where appropriate

* **Data Classification**
  * Automated sensitive data identification
  * Classification-based access controls
  * Data handling policies based on sensitivity
  * Data loss prevention controls

* **Access Controls**
  * Attribute-based access control
  * Just-in-time access provisioning
  * Database-level security
  * Multi-tenancy isolation

* **Data Lifecycle Management**
  * Secure data creation and ingestion
  * Retention policies
  * Secure backup and recovery
  * Secure deletion and sanitization

### 5. Identity and Access Management

IAM controls manage authentication, authorization, and access control:

* **Authentication**
  * Multi-factor authentication
  * Single sign-on (SSO) integration
  * Password strength policies
  * Account lockout protections

* **Authorization**
  * Role-based access control
  * Attribute-based access policies
  * Just-in-time privileged access
  * Separation of duties enforcement

* **Identity Management**
  * Centralized user directory
  * Automated provisioning/deprovisioning
  * Regular access reviews
  * Privileged account management

* **Auditing**
  * Authentication activity logging
  * Authorization decision logging
  * Privileged activity monitoring
  * Access pattern analysis

### 6. Security Monitoring and Operations

Security operations provide continuous monitoring and response capabilities:

* **Logging and Monitoring**
  * Centralized log collection
  * Security information and event management (SIEM)
  * Real-time security alerting
  * Security metrics and dashboards

* **Vulnerability Management**
  * Regular automated scanning
  * Penetration testing
  * Patch management
  * Risk-based remediation prioritization

* **Incident Response**
  * Defined incident response procedures
  * Automated detection and containment
  * Forensic investigation capabilities
  * Post-incident analysis and improvement

* **Threat Intelligence**
  * Integration of threat feeds
  * Indicators of compromise monitoring
  * Proactive threat hunting
  * Security advisory monitoring

## Compliance Framework Integration

The security architecture is designed to satisfy requirements from:

* ISO 27001/27002
* SOC 2 Type II
* GDPR
* NIST Cybersecurity Framework
* CIS Critical Security Controls

Each architectural component maps to specific compliance requirements, and the platform includes built-in controls to demonstrate and maintain compliance.

## Security Testing and Assurance

The platform undergoes continuous security evaluation:

* Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
* Regular vulnerability scanning
* Annual penetration testing
* Security architecture reviews
* Third-party security assessments

## Continuous Improvement

The security architecture evolves through:

* Regular threat model updates
* Incident response lessons learned
* New threat adaptation
* Security technology evaluation
* Industry best practice monitoring
