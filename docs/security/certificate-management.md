## Certificate Types and Usage

The platform uses several types of certificates for different purposes:

### Certificate Authority (CA)

- **Internal CA**
  - Issues certificates for internal services
  - Not used for customer-facing services

- **Requirements**
  - 4096-bit RSA or ECC P-384 keys
  - SHA-256 signature algorithm
  - Offline root CA
  - Online intermediate CA
  - Maximum 10-year validity for root CA
  - Maximum 5-year validity for intermediate CA

### Internal Service Certificates

- **Service-to-Service Communication**
  - Database connections
  - Internal API calls
  - Microservice communication

- **Requirements**
  - Internal CA-issued
  - 2048-bit RSA or ECC P-256 keys
  - SHA-256 signature algorithm
  - Maximum 2-year validity

### Public-Facing SSL/TLS Certificates

- **Web Application Endpoints**
  - Admin interfaces
  - API endpoints
  - Customer-facing web interfaces

- **Requirements**
  - Extended Validation (EV) for production
  - Issued by trusted public CA
  - Maximum 1-year validity
  - Organization Validation (OV) for staging
  - SHA-256 signature algorithm
  - 2048-bit RSA or ECC P-256 keys

## Certificate Lifecycle Management

### Acquisition

#### Internal Certificates

1. **Request Submission**
   - Include service details and justification
   - Specify required subject names and validity period
   - Submit certificate request to security team

2. **Certificate Issuance**
   - Deliver through secure channel
   - Include installation instructions
   - Security team issues certificate from internal CA

#### Public Certificates

1. **Request Generation**
   - Generate CSR with appropriate subject information
   - Include Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for all domains
   - Use secure key generation practices

2. **CA Validation**
   - Complete domain validation (DV) through DNS or file-based challenges
   - For OV/EV certs, complete organizational validation process
   - Submit all required documentation

3. **Certificate Issuance**
   - Download certificate and full chain
   - Store securely in certificate management system
   - Verify certificate attributes match request

### Deployment

1. **Pre-deployment Testing**
   - Test with TLS analyzers for configuration errors
   - Validate OCSP/CRL functioning properly
   - Verify certificate chain in non-production environment

2. **Certificate Installation**
   - Configure appropriate permissions
   - Deploy using automation (Ansible/Terraform)
   - Enable Perfect Forward Secrecy and HSTS
   - Follow security best practices for private key protection

3. **Post-deployment Validation**
   - Confirm certificate transparency logs
   - Test with various client configurations
   - Verify through external scanners (SSL Labs, ImmuniWeb)

### Monitoring and Renewal

1. **Monitoring**
   - Alert at 60, 30, 15, 7, and 3 days before expiration
   - Automated daily checks for expiration
   - Monitor CT logs for unauthorized certificates

2. **Renewal Process**
   - Generate new CSR with updated requirements if needed
   - Initiate renewal 30 days before expiration
   - Use automation for Let's Encrypt certificates
   - Validate renewed certificate before deployment

3. **Emergency Replacement**
   - Alternate validation methods ready
   - Documented procedure for after-hours replacement
   - Incident response plan for key compromise
   - Pre-approved emergency contacts with CA

### Revocation

1. **Triggers for Revocation**
   - Incorrect certificate information
   - Private key compromise
   - System decommissioning
   - Unauthorized issuance

2. **Revocation Process**
   - Communicate to stakeholders if public-facing
   - Document reason for revocation
   - Submit revocation request to issuing CA
   - Verify revocation through OCSP/CRL

## Certificate Inventory Management

### Documentation Requirements

- Certificate owner and contacts
- Issuing CA
- Key parameters (size, algorithm)
- Location in load balancers/servers
- Location of private keys
- Renewal procedures
- System/service usage
- Validity period

### Inventory Tools

- API integration with cloud providers
- Automated discovery and tracking
- Centralized certificate inventory system
- Regular reconciliation with active systems

## Key Protection

### Private Key Security

- Access controls based on role
- Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for high-value keys
- Key backup procedures with dual control
- Key encryption at rest
- No export of private keys in plaintext format

### Storage Locations

- Development: Development-only CAs with clear key usage policies
- Production: Hardware security modules or secure key stores
- Staging: Encrypted file systems with access controls

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Application Teams | Implement proper key usage, Request certificates, Report security incidents |
| DevOps Team | Configure TLS settings, Deploy certificates, Implement automated renewal |
| Incident Response | Coordinate emergency renewals, Handle key compromise events |
| Monitoring Team | Alert on anomalies, Monitor certificate expiration, Verify configuration |
| Security Team | Approve certificate requests, Define certificate policies, Manage CA infrastructure |

## Compliance Requirements

- HIPAA requirements for PHI protection
- ISO 27001 cryptography requirements
- PCI-DSS requirements for cardholder data environments
- SOC2 certificate management controls

## Audit and Logging

- Annual audit of CA operations
- Document approval workflow
- Log all certificate issuance and revocation events
- Record access to private keys
- Regular reviews of certificate inventory

## Emergency Procedures

### Key Compromise Response

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Revoke compromised certificate
   - Rotate all secrets associated with the system

2. **Investigation**
   - Determine cause and scope of compromise
   - Document timeline of events
   - Identify potential data exposure

3. **Recovery**
   - Deploy to all affected systems
   - Issue replacement certificates with new keys
   - Verify proper implementation
