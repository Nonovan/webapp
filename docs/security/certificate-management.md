# Certificate Management Procedures

This document outlines the procedures for managing SSL/TLS certificates within the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

## Certificate Types and Usage

The platform uses several types of certificates for different purposes:

### Public-Facing SSL/TLS Certificates

* **Web Application Endpoints**
  * Customer-facing web interfaces
  * API endpoints
  * Admin interfaces

* **Requirements**
  * Issued by trusted public CA
  * Extended Validation (EV) for production
  * Organization Validation (OV) for staging
  * 2048-bit RSA or ECC P-256 keys
  * SHA-256 signature algorithm
  * Maximum 1-year validity

### Internal Service Certificates

* **Service-to-Service Communication**
  * Internal API calls
  * Microservice communication
  * Database connections

* **Requirements**
  * Internal CA-issued
  * 2048-bit RSA or ECC P-256 keys
  * SHA-256 signature algorithm
  * Maximum 2-year validity

### Certificate Authority (CA)

* **Internal CA**
  * Issues certificates for internal services
  * Not used for customer-facing services

* **Requirements**
  * 4096-bit RSA or ECC P-384 keys
  * SHA-256 signature algorithm
  * Offline root CA
  * Online intermediate CA
  * Maximum 10-year validity for root CA
  * Maximum 5-year validity for intermediate CA

## Certificate Lifecycle Management

### Acquisition

#### Public Certificates

1. **Request Generation**
   * Generate CSR with appropriate subject information
   * Include Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for all domains
   * Use secure key generation practices

2. **CA Validation**
   * Complete domain validation (DV) through DNS or file-based challenges
   * For OV/EV certs, complete organizational validation process
   * Submit all required documentation

3. **Certificate Issuance**
   * Download certificate and full chain
   * Verify certificate attributes match request
   * Store securely in certificate management system

#### Internal Certificates

1. **Request Submission**
   * Submit certificate request to security team
   * Include service details and justification
   * Specify required subject names and validity period

2. **Certificate Issuance**
   * Security team issues certificate from internal CA
   * Deliver through secure channel
   * Include installation instructions

### Deployment

1. **Pre-deployment Testing**
   * Verify certificate chain in non-production environment
   * Test with TLS analyzers for configuration errors
   * Validate OCSP/CRL functioning properly

2. **Certificate Installation**
   * Deploy using automation (Ansible/Terraform)
   * Configure appropriate permissions
   * Enable Perfect Forward Secrecy and HSTS
   * Follow security best practices for private key protection

3. **Post-deployment Validation**
   * Verify through external scanners (SSL Labs, ImmuniWeb)
   * Test with various client configurations
   * Confirm certificate transparency logs

### Monitoring and Renewal

1. **Monitoring**
   * Automated daily checks for expiration
   * Alert at 60, 30, 15, 7, and 3 days before expiration
   * Monitor CT logs for unauthorized certificates

2. **Renewal Process**
   * Initiate renewal 30 days before expiration
   * Generate new CSR with updated requirements if needed
   * Use automation for Let's Encrypt certificates
   * Validate renewed certificate before deployment

3. **Emergency Replacement**
   * Documented procedure for after-hours replacement
   * Pre-approved emergency contacts with CA
   * Alternate validation methods ready
   * Incident response plan for key compromise

### Revocation

1. **Triggers for Revocation**
   * Private key compromise
   * Incorrect certificate information
   * System decommissioning
   * Unauthorized issuance

2. **Revocation Process**
   * Submit revocation request to issuing CA
   * Verify revocation through OCSP/CRL
   * Document reason for revocation
   * Communicate to stakeholders if public-facing

## Certificate Inventory Management

### Documentation Requirements

* Certificate owner and contacts
* System/service usage
* Issuing CA
* Key parameters (size, algorithm)
* Validity period
* Renewal procedures
* Location of private keys
* Location in load balancers/servers

### Inventory Tools

* Centralized certificate inventory system
* Automated discovery and tracking
* API integration with cloud providers
* Regular reconciliation with active systems

## Key Protection

### Private Key Security

* Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for high-value keys
* Key encryption at rest
* Access controls based on role
* Key backup procedures with dual control
* No export of private keys in plaintext format

### Storage Locations

* Production: Hardware security modules or secure key stores
* Staging: Encrypted file systems with access controls
* Development: Development-only CAs with clear key usage policies

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Security Team | Manage CA infrastructure, Define certificate policies, Approve certificate requests |
| DevOps Team | Deploy certificates, Configure TLS settings, Implement automated renewal |
| Application Teams | Request certificates, Implement proper key usage, Report security incidents |
| Monitoring Team | Monitor certificate expiration, Alert on anomalies, Verify configuration |
| Incident Response | Handle key compromise events, Coordinate emergency renewals |

## Compliance Requirements

* PCI-DSS requirements for cardholder data environments
* HIPAA requirements for PHI protection
* SOC2 certificate management controls
* ISO 27001 cryptography requirements

## Audit and Logging

* Log all certificate issuance and revocation events
* Record access to private keys
* Document approval workflow
* Regular reviews of certificate inventory
* Annual audit of CA operations

## Emergency Procedures

### Key Compromise Response

1. **Immediate Actions**
   * Revoke compromised certificate
   * Isolate affected systems
   * Rotate all secrets associated with the system

2. **Investigation**
   * Determine cause and scope of compromise
   * Identify potential data exposure
   * Document timeline of events

3. **Recovery**
   * Issue replacement certificates with new keys
   * Deploy to all affected systems
   * Verify proper implementation
