## Overview

Network segmentation is a critical security control that divides the network into isolated segments, creating security boundaries that limit an attacker's ability to move laterally within the environment. The Cloud Infrastructure Platform implements a defense-in-depth approach to network segmentation across both cloud and on-premises environments, using multiple technologies and controls to enforce boundaries between network zones.

## Design Principles

The network segmentation architecture follows these core principles:

1. **Default Deny**
   - All traffic between segments is denied by default
   - Explicit rules allow only necessary traffic
   - Regular access reviews to validate required communications

2. **Least Privilege**
   - Minimal network access required for operations
   - Time-bound access for temporary connectivity needs
   - Service-specific controls rather than broad permissions

3. **Microsegmentation**
   - Segmentation extends to the workload level
   - Dynamic policies based on identity and context
   - Software-defined perimeters for critical workloads

4. **Zero Trust**
   - Network location is not a primary trust factor
   - Authentication and authorization at every boundary
   - Continuous verification through session monitoring
   - Mutual TLS for service-to-service communication

## Network Zones

The network architecture is divided into the following security zones:

### 1. External Zone

- **Description**: Public-facing internet boundary
- **Systems**: Load balancers, WAF, edge routers, DDoS protection
- **Traffic Controls**: Limited inbound on standard ports (80/443), minimal outbound
- **Security Controls**: Traffic filtering, anomaly detection, TLS termination

### 2. DMZ Zone

- **Description**: Demilitarized zone for public-facing services
- **Systems**: Web servers, API gateways, reverse proxies
- **Traffic Controls**: Accepts traffic from External Zone, initiates limited traffic to App Zone
- **Security Controls**: Host-based firewalls, WAF, network IDS/IPS

### 3. Application Zone

- **Description**: Houses application processing logic
- **Systems**: Application servers, middleware, message queues
- **Traffic Controls**: Accepts traffic from DMZ, initiates traffic to Data Zone
- **Security Controls**: Application-aware firewall rules, service mesh controls

### 4. Data Zone

- **Description**: Contains sensitive data repositories
- **Systems**: Databases, storage systems, data warehouses
- **Traffic Controls**: Accepts traffic from App Zone, limited outbound
- **Security Controls**: Database firewalls, access controls, encryption gateways

### 5. Management Zone

- **Description**: Administrative access environment
- **Systems**: Jump servers, management workstations
- **Traffic Controls**: Heavily restricted, audited access to other zones
- **Security Controls**: Multi-factor authentication, privileged access management

### 6. DevOps Zone

- **Description**: Development and operations environment
- **Systems**: CI/CD pipelines, version control, build servers
- **Traffic Controls**: Isolated from production, controlled deployment paths
- **Security Controls**: Vulnerability scanning, artifact validation

### 7. Backup Zone

- **Description**: Data backup and recovery systems
- **Systems**: Backup servers, archive storage
- **Traffic Controls**: One-way data flow from production, air-gapped where possible
- **Security Controls**: Immutable storage, encryption, access controls

## Implementation

### Cloud Environments

## Access Controls

Access between network zones is strictly controlled through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Network-Level Controls**
   - IP-based access control lists
   - Protocol and port restrictions
   - Traffic filtering and deep packet inspection
   - Stateful traffic analysis

2. **Identity-Based Controls**
   - Service identity for service-to-service communications
   - User identity for interactive access
   - Device posture for endpoint validation
   - Context-aware access policies

3. **Application-Level Controls**
   - API gateways for centralized access control
   - Service mesh for fine-grained service-to-service controls
   - Web application firewalls for HTTP/S traffic inspection
   - Content filtering and data loss prevention

## Security Controls

Multiple security controls enforce and strengthen network segmentation:

### Network Controls

- **Border Firewalls**: Perimeter protection with stateful inspection
- **Internal Firewalls**: Zone separation with application awareness
- **Micro-segmentation**: Workload-level traffic control
- **IDS/IPS**: Traffic monitoring and threat prevention
- **Network Monitoring**: Flow analysis and anomaly detection

### Authentication Controls

- **Service Identity**: Workload identity for service authentication
- **Mutual TLS**: Two-way certificate validation for services
- **Jump Servers**: Controlled access points for administrative access
- **Privileged Access Workstations**: Hardened systems for administrative tasks
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Enhanced authentication at zone boundaries

### Cloud-Specific Controls

- **Service Endpoints**: Restricted service access from authorized networks
- **VPC Peering Controls**: Restricted cross-VPC communication
- **Transit Gateway**: Centralized connection management
- **Network Access Policies**: Identity-based network authorization

## Monitoring and Verification
