# Malware Incident Response Playbook

## Incident Overview

This playbook provides structured procedures for responding to malware incidents in the Cloud Infrastructure Platform. Malware incidents involve the detection of malicious software that has been deployed within the organization's environment with the intent to compromise system integrity, confidentiality, or availability.

### Severity Classification Guidelines

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Malware with active data exfiltration capabilities, ransomware with active encryption, rootkits with privileged access, or malware affecting critical systems |
| **High** | Malware with potential for data exfiltration, credential theft, lateral movement capabilities, or affecting multiple systems |
| **Medium** | Contained malware with limited functionality, adware/spyware with minimal impact, or affecting non-critical systems |
| **Low** | Potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), suspicious files that have been blocked or quarantined before execution |

### Common Indicators of Compromise

- Antivirus/EDR alerts
- Anomalous system behavior or performance
- Unexpected network connections
- Unusual process activity
- Unauthorized system changes
- Suspicious file modifications
- Unexpected account activity
- Command and control (C2) traffic
- Unusual DNS queries
- Disabled security controls

### Potential Business Impact

- Data theft or exfiltration
- Operational disruption

## Containment

### Immediate Containment Actions

1. **Isolate Affected Systems**

   ```python
   # Isolate system from the network
   from admin.security.incident_response_kit import network_isolation

   # Network isolation of compromised system
   isolation_result = network_isolation.isolate_system(
       target="infected-host-01",
       isolation_method="acl",
       allow_ip="10.0.0.5",  # Security analyst workstation
       duration="4h",
       incident_id="IR-2023-042"
   )
   ```

2. **Quarantine Malware Files**

   ```python
   # Quarantine suspicious files
   from admin.security.incident_response_kit import malware_containment

   # Initialize containment instance
   containment = malware_containment.MalwareContainment(incident_id="IR-2023-042")

   # Quarantine malicious file
   result = containment.quarantine_file(
       file_path="/path/to/malicious/file.exe",
       encrypt=True
   )
   ```

3. **Isolate Malicious Processes**

   ```python
   # Isolate running malicious process
   from admin.security.incident_response_kit import malware_containment

   # Initialize containment instance
   containment = malware_containment.MalwareContainment(incident_id="IR-2023-042")

   # Suspend malicious process
   result = containment.isolate_process(
       pid=1234,
       method="suspend"
   )
   ```

       incident_id="IR-2023-042"
   )
   ```

5. **Disable Compromised Accounts**

   ```python
   # Lock potentially compromised accounts
   from core.security import lock_user_account

   # Lock account identified as compromised
   lock_user_account(
       username="compromised_account",
       reason="Security incident #IR-2023-042",
