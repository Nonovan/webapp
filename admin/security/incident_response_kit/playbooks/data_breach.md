# Data Breach Response Playbook

## Incident Overview

This playbook provides structured procedures for responding to data breach incidents in the Cloud Infrastructure Platform. Data breach incidents involve unauthorized access, acquisition, use, or disclosure of sensitive, protected, or confidential data.

### Severity Classification Guidelines

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Large-scale breach of sensitive data (PII, PHI, financial data) with confirmed exfiltration, regulatory reporting requirements, or potential for significant harm |
| **High** | Breach of sensitive data with limited scope, potential regulatory implications, or moderate risk of harm |
| **Medium** | Limited breach of internal data with no confirmed exfiltration or breach of non-sensitive customer data |
| **Low** | Potential exposure of non-sensitive data with no evidence of exfiltration or access |

### Common Indicators of Compromise

- Unusual database query patterns or volume
- Unexpected data transfers or downloads
- Suspicious access to sensitive data repositories
- Unauthorized access to data storage
- Abnormal API usage patterns accessing sensitive data
- DLP alerts indicating potential data leakage
- Unexpected schema changes or data modifications
- Customer reports of their data appearing elsewhere
- Unusual patterns of file access or copying
- Authentication anomalies preceding data access

### Potential Business Impact

- Regulatory penalties and compliance violations
- Legal liability and potential lawsuits
- Reputational damage and loss of customer trust
- Financial impact from response and remediation
- Operational disruption during investigation
- Intellectual property loss
- Costs of customer notification and credit monitoring
- Extended security monitoring requirements
- Increased regulatory scrutiny
- Business relationship impacts with partners and vendors

### Required Response Team Roles

- **Security Analyst**: Lead investigation and evidence collection
- **Data Protection Officer**: Regulatory compliance assessment
