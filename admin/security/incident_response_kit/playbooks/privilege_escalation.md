# Privilege Escalation Response Playbook

## Incident Overview

This playbook provides structured procedures for responding to privilege escalation incidents in the Cloud Infrastructure Platform. Privilege escalation incidents involve unauthorized elevation of access rights, where an entity gains privileges beyond those initially granted, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems.

### Severity Classification Guidelines

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Successful privilege escalation to superuser/root/admin level on production systems, widespread access across multiple critical systems, or evidence of malicious intent with data exfiltration |
| **High** | Successful privilege escalation on a single production system, escalation to privileged service accounts, or significant lateral movement potential |
| **Medium** | Attempted privilege escalation with partial success, escalation within non-production environments, or limited scope of impact |
| **Low** | Failed privilege escalation attempts, suspicious activity without confirmation of successful privilege increase |

### Common Indicators of Compromise

- Unexpected privilege changes in access logs
- User accounts executing commands beyond their privilege level
- Modification of sudoers files or permission changes
- Unexpected creation of high-privilege accounts
- Security tool alerts for known privilege escalation techniques
- Unusual process activities or binaries with SUID/SGID bits
- Unexpected use of sensitive administrative commands
- Authentication from unusual sources for privileged operations
- Abnormal API calls for privilege or role modifications
- Suspicious exploitation tools or exploitation signatures

### Potential Business Impact

- Unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems
- Complete compromise of affected systems
- Lateral movement to additional systems
- Disruption of critical business services
- Regulatory compliance violations
- Intellectual property theft
- Reputational damage
- Financial losses from system misuse or theft

### Required Response Team Roles

- **Security Analyst**: Lead investigation and coordinate response activities
- **System Administrator**: Assist with system analysis and containment
- **Network Administrator**: Assist with network-based evidence collection and isolation
- **Cloud Security Specialist**: Assist with cloud environment assessment and remediation
