## Overview

These incident response playbooks follow the NIST SP 800-61 incident handling framework and provide detailed, actionable procedures for responding to specific types of security incidents. Each playbook is designed to guide incident responders through the complete incident lifecycle: detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities. The playbooks incorporate lessons learned from previous incidents and industry best practices to ensure effective response to security threats.

## Playbook Structure

Each playbook follows a consistent structure to ensure clarity and completeness:

### 1. Incident Overview

- Description of the incident type
- Severity classification guidelines
- Common indicators of compromise
- Potential business impact
- Required response team roles

### 2. Detection and Identification

- Detection sources and systems
- Initial triage procedures
- Key artifacts and log sources
- Verification steps
- False positive checks

### 3. Containment

- Immediate containment actions
- System isolation procedures
- Evidence preservation steps
- Communication requirements
- Stakeholder notification templates

### 4. Eradication

- Root cause identification
- Threat removal procedures
- Affected systems validation
- Vulnerability remediation
- Security gap closure

### 5. Recovery

- System restoration procedures
- Verification testing steps
- Monitoring requirements
- Phased recovery approach
- Business continuity coordination

### 6. Post-Incident Activities

- Incident documentation requirements
- Lessons learned template
- Security improvement recommendations
- Training and awareness updates
- Metrics and KPI tracking

## Usage Guidelines

### Playbook Selection

1. Identify the primary incident type based on initial reports and alerts
2. Select the most appropriate playbook based on the incident characteristics
3. Document the selection rationale in the incident ticket
4. Be prepared to switch or combine playbooks as new information emerges

### Playbook Execution

1. Follow the playbook steps sequentially unless circumstances dictate otherwise
2. Document all deviations from standard procedures with justification
3. Record completion of each major section in the incident tracking system
4. Maintain communication with the incident response team throughout execution
5. Update the incident commander on progress and any obstacles encountered

### Playbook Customization

When necessary, customize the standard playbook to address specific incident circumstances:

```bash
# Create a customized playbook for a specific incident
cp data_breach.md incident-42-data-breach-response.md

# Customize the playbook with specific details and assign to the response team
./customize_playbook.py --template incident-42-data-breach-response.md \
    --incident-id 42 \
    --affected-systems "db-prod-03,web-prod-01" \
    --team-lead "security-analyst@example.com"
```

## Best Practices & Security

- **Documentation**: Document all actions taken during incident response
- **Communication**: Maintain regular communication with the incident response team and stakeholders
- **Evidence Handling**: Follow proper chain of custody procedures for all evidence
- **Secure Operations**: Execute response procedures using secure systems and networks
- **Authorization**: Ensure proper authorization before executing any containment or recovery actions
- **Parallel Processing**: Use parallel teams for different playbook sections when time is critical
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the risk of each action before execution
- **Backup Strategy**: Create backups before making significant system changes
- **Secure Communications**: Use encrypted communications for discussing incident details
- **Need-to-Know Principle**: Limit incident information to those who need to know

## Common Response Elements

These elements are common across all playbooks:

- **Initial Assessment**: All playbooks begin with an initial assessment phase
- **Evidence Collection**: Evidence collection procedures following forensic best practices
- **Communication Templates**: Pre-approved communication templates for different audiences
- **Escalation Paths**: Clear escalation procedures for different scenarios
- **Documentation Requirements**: Standard documentation requirements for legal and compliance purposes
- **Tool References**: References to specific tools in the incident response kit
- **Contact Information**: References to the central contact list for specialized assistance
- **Regulatory Guidance**: References to applicable regulatory requirements
- **Timeline Tracking**: Procedures for tracking the incident timeline
- **Status Reporting**: Templates for status reporting to stakeholders
