## Usage Guidelines

### Playbook Selection

1. Identify the primary incident type based on initial reports and alerts
2. Select the most appropriate playbook based on the incident characteristics
3. Document the selection rationale in the incident ticket
4. Be prepared to switch or combine playbooks as new information emerges

### Playbook Execution

1. Follow the playbook steps sequentially unless circumstances dictate otherwise
2. Document all deviations from standard procedures with justification
3. Record completion of each major section in the incident tracking system
4. Maintain communication with the incident response team throughout execution
5. Update the incident commander on progress and any obstacles encountered

### Playbook Automation

The playbooks can be executed using the `run_playbook` utility from the incident response toolkit:

```python
from admin.security.incident_response_kit import run_playbook

# Run a specific playbook for an incident
run_playbook(
    playbook_name="web_application_attack",
    incident_id="IR-2023-047",
    affected_systems=["web-app-01", "api-gateway"],
    team_lead="security-analyst@example.com"
)

# To get information about available playbooks
from admin.security.incident_response_kit import get_available_playbooks, get_playbook_details

# List all available playbooks
available_playbooks = get_available_playbooks()
print(f"Available playbooks: {available_playbooks}")

# Get details about a specific playbook
playbook_details = get_playbook_details("web_application_attack")
print(f"Sections in web application attack playbook: {playbook_details['sections']}")
```

### Playbook Customization

When necessary, customize the standard playbook to address specific incident circumstances:

```bash
# Create a customized playbook for a specific incident
cp data_breach.md incident-42-data-breach-response.md

# Customize the playbook with specific details and assign to the response team
./customize_playbook.py --template incident-42-data-breach-response.md \
    --incident-id 42 \
    --affected-systems "db-prod-03,web-prod-01" \
    --team-lead "security-analyst@example.com"
```
