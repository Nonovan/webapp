# Denial of Service Response Playbook

## Incident Overview

This playbook provides structured procedures for responding to Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) incidents in the Cloud Infrastructure Platform. These incidents involve attempts to disrupt the availability of services, networks, systems, or applications by overwhelming resources or exploiting vulnerabilities that impact service availability.

### Severity Classification Guidelines

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Complete outage of business-critical services, extensive customer impact, or total inability to conduct business operations |
| **High** | Significant degradation of critical services, potential SLA violations, or substantial customer impact |
| **Medium** | Moderate service degradation, isolated service impacts, or limited customer visibility |
| **Low** | Minimal service impact, no customer visibility, automatically mitigated attacks by existing controls |

### Common Indicators of Compromise

- Significant increase in network traffic volume
- Degraded application performance or timeouts
- Server resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, connections)
- Service availability alerts
- Network latency increases
- Application error rate spikes
