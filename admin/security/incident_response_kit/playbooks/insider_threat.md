# Insider Threat Response Playbook

## Incident Overview

This playbook provides structured procedures for responding to insider threat incidents in the Cloud Infrastructure Platform. Insider threat incidents involve the misuse of authorized access by employees, contractors, or other trusted individuals to harm the organization's confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or systems.

### Severity Classification Guidelines

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Actions causing severe damage to critical systems/data, sabotage of critical infrastructure, large-scale data exfiltration by privileged users, or intentional actions leading to significant business impact |
| **High** | Significant unauthorized data access/theft, establishment of persistent backdoor access, system sabotage, or pattern of policy violations with potential regulatory impact |
| **Medium** | Isolated policy violations involving sensitive data, unauthorized system modification, suspicious exfiltration attempts, or suspicious privilege usage |
| **Low** | Minor policy violations, unusual but explainable access patterns, or suspicious behavior with no evidence of malicious intent |

### Common Indicators of Compromise
