# Unauthorized Access Response Playbook

## Incident Overview

This playbook provides structured procedures for responding to unauthorized access incidents in the Cloud Infrastructure Platform. Unauthorized access incidents involve any situation where a system, application, data, or network is accessed without proper authorization, potentially compromising confidentiality, integrity, or availability of resources.

### Severity Classification Guidelines

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Unauthorized access to highly privileged accounts (domain/enterprise admin, root), critical infrastructure systems, regulated/sensitive data repositories, or widespread access across multiple critical systems |
| **High** | Unauthorized access to application administrator accounts, sensitive production systems, business-critical data, cloud management consoles, or pervasive access across multiple systems |
| **Medium** | Unauthorized access to standard user accounts, non-critical business applications, internal development systems, or limited data with moderate sensitivity |
| **Low** | Unauthorized access to low-privilege accounts, non-sensitive systems, public-facing content, or unsuccessful access attempts with limited potential impact |

### Common Indicators of Compromise

- Authentication logs showing successful logins from unusual sources
- Failed authentication attempts followed by successful authentication
- Access to systems or resources outside normal business hours
- Geographic impossibilities (authentication from multiple distant locations)
- Account usage during employee vacation or non-working periods
- Usage patterns inconsistent with legitimate user behavior
- Modification of access controls or security settings
- Creation of new accounts or modification of existing privileges
- Access to sensitive data without business justification
- Unusual lateral movement across systems
- Authentication from previously unseen IP addresses or locations
- Unusual process or service execution following authentication

### Potential Business Impact

- Unauthorized access to sensitive information or intellectual property
- Regulatory compliance violations and potential penalties
- Lateral movement leading to broader infrastructure compromise
- System manipulation affecting integrity of operations or data
- Reputational damage from security breach disclosure
- Financial losses from stolen information or business disruption
- Privacy breaches requiring customer notification
- Installation of persistent access mechanisms or backdoors
- Service disruption from unauthorized system changes

### Required Response Team Roles

- **Security Analyst**: Lead investigation and coordinate response activities
- **System Administrator**: Assist with system analysis and access validation
- **Network Administrator**: Assist with network traffic analysis and correlation
- **Identity & Access Management Specialist**: Review authentication logs and access controls
- **Legal/Compliance Officer**: Advise on legal and regulatory implications (for high/critical severity)
- **Executive Sponsor**: Provide approval for critical response actions (for high/critical severity)
