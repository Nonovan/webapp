## Key Regulations

### Data Protection and Privacy Regulations

| Regulation | Jurisdiction | Coverage | Key Requirements |
|------------|--------------|----------|------------------|
| **GDPR** | European Union | Personal data of EU residents | Notification to supervisory authority within 72 hours; notification to affected individuals without undue delay when high risk to rights/freedoms |
| **CCPA/CPRA** | California, USA | Personal information of California residents | Notification to affected California residents in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay |
| **PIPEDA** | Canada | Personal information of Canadian individuals | Notification to individuals and Privacy Commissioner where reasonable risk of significant harm |
| **LGPD** | Brazil | Personal data of Brazilian citizens | Notification to national authority and affected data subjects in reasonable time |
| **POPIA** | South Africa | Personal information of South African residents | Notification to Regulator and data subjects as soon as reasonably possible |
| **State Data Breach Laws** | Various US States | Personal information of state residents | Varies by state; generally requires notification without unreasonable delay |

### Industry-Specific Regulations

| Regulation | Industry | Coverage | Key Requirements |
|------------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **HIPAA** | Healthcare | Protected health information | Notification to individuals without unreasonable delay (60 days maximum); notification to HHS; media notification for large breaches |
| **PCI DSS** | Payment Card | Cardholder data | Notification to payment card brands and acquiring bank as soon as possible |
| **GLBA** | Financial | Customer financial data | Notification to customers and primary regulatory agency |
| **NIS2 Directive** | Critical Infrastructure (EU) | Essential services | Notification to competent authority without undue delay (24 hours for early warning) |
| **DORA** | Financial (EU) | Financial entities | Notification to competent authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of significant incident |

### Sector-Specific Regulations

| Regulation | Sector | Coverage | Key Requirements |
|------------|--------|----------|------------------|
| **SEC Rules** | Public Companies | Material cybersecurity incidents | Form 8-K filing within four business days for material incidents |
| **NERC CIP** | Electricity | Critical infrastructure systems | NERC E-ISAC notification requirements for cyber incidents |
| **TSA Directives** | Transportation | Critical infrastructure | 24-hour notification for specified incidents |
| **FFIEC Guidance** | Financial | Financial institutions | Notification to primary regulator and customers; timing varies |

## Notification Timeframes

### Mandatory Reporting Deadlines

| Regulation | Initial Notification Deadline | Follow-up Requirements | Exception Process |
|------------|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **GDPR** | 72 hours from becoming aware | Updates as new information becomes available | Document why notification was delayed if exceeding 72-hour timeframe |
| **HIPAA** | 60 days from discovery | Annual report for smaller breaches | No exceptions for deadline, but can provide incremental reports |
| **PCI DSS** | Immediately upon discovery | Report within 3 days; forensic investigation | Document all communication with payment brands |
| **US State Laws** | Varies: typically without "unreasonable delay" | Updates when significant new information available | Law enforcement delay exceptions with documentation |
| **SEC Rules** | 4 business days for Form 8-K | Updates in quarterly/annual reports | Limited extension for national security |
| **DORA** | 24 hours after awareness | Intermediate report after 72h; final report in 1 month | Justify delay if initial deadline not met |
| **NIS2** | 24 hours for early warning | Detailed report within 72 hours | Document any delay with justification |

### Time Calculation Guidelines

1. **Time of Discovery**
   - The clock starts when organization becomes "aware" of incident
   - "Aware" typically means knowledge by person responsible for compliance
   - Time of first detection by automated systems not necessarily start time
   - Document precise time of awareness with supporting evidence

2. **Business Hours vs. Calendar Hours**
   - Most regulations use calendar hours/days, not business days
   - GDPR, HIPAA, DORA use calendar hours (24x7)
   - SEC uses business days for Form 8-K
   - Australian regulations use calendar days but only count when appropriate person becomes aware

3. **Deadline Extensions**
   - Law enforcement delays may extend deadlines (document properly)
   - Technical impossibility may justify extensions in some jurisdictions
   - National security exceptions may apply (limited scope)
   - Phased notification approach may be permissible with justification

## Determination Framework

### Notification Threshold Assessment

1. **Data Breach Threshold Analysis**

   - **Personal Data Assessment**
     - Determine if exposed data meets legal definition of protected categories
     - Assess whether data was accessed, acquired, or exfiltrated
     - Evaluate if encryption or other security controls were compromised
     - Consider data sensitivity levels and combinations of data elements

   - **Risk of Harm Analysis**
     - Evaluate likelihood of identity theft or financial harm
     - Assess potential for reputational damage
     - Consider possible discrimination risks
     - Evaluate physical safety implications
     - Document reasoning for harm determination

2. **Materiality Assessment (SEC Rules)**

   - **Business Impact Evaluation**
     - Effect on operations (substantial disruption)
     - Financial impact (costs, legal liabilities, remediation expenses)
     - Reputation impact (customer/partner trust)
     - Impact on financial statements or future performance

   - **Technical Assessment**
     - Critical system compromise
     - Duration of incident
     - Data exfiltration confirmation
     - Ransom payment considerations
     - Intellectual property compromise

3. **Sectoral Notification Triggers**

   - **Critical Infrastructure Criteria**
     - Impact on availability of essential services
     - Cross-sector dependency implications
     - Duration of service disruption
     - Number of users/customers impacted
     - Geographic scope of impact

   - **Healthcare-Specific Assessment**
     - PHI (Protected Health Information) compromise determination
     - Low probability of compromise exceptions assessment
     - Use of safe harbor provisions (encryption evaluation)
     - Assessment of disclosure, acquisition, and access

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Factor | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk | Supporting Evidence |
|-------------|----------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Data Type** | Public information | Internal confidential | PII, PHI, financial | Data classification inventory |
| **Access Type** | Temporary view | Download | Exfiltration confirmed | Log analysis, forensics |
| **Scope** | Single record | Limited dataset | Large-scale breach | Affected record count |
| **Impact** | Minimal disruption | Operational impact | Critical service failure | Business impact analysis |

## Multi-Jurisdiction Incidents

### Cross-Border Notification Strategy

1. **Jurisdiction Determination Process**
   - Identify affected individuals' residency or location
   - Map data storage and processing locations
   - Determine corporate entity legal presence
   - Analyze applicable laws and their extraterritorial scope
   - Document jurisdiction determination logic

2. **Primary Authority Identification**
   - Identify lead supervisory authority (GDPR)
   - Determine primary regulator for financial institutions
   - Establish federal vs. state authority primacy
   - Consult regulatory coordination mechanisms
   - Document authority selection justification

3. **Notification Coordination Approach**
   - Create master notification calendar with all deadlines
   - Develop consistent core messaging across jurisdictions
   - Adjust notification content for jurisdiction-specific requirements
   - Establish communication sequence among authorities
   - Maintain consolidated notification tracking system

### Multiple US State Requirements
