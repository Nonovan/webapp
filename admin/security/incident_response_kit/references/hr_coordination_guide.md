## Overview

This guide outlines the proper coordination protocols between security teams and Human Resources (HR) during security incidents that involve employee actions or require employee-related responses. Effective HR coordination is critical when incidents involve potential insider threats, misuse of company resources, policy violations, or require disciplinary actions. The procedures described ensure appropriate handling of sensitive employee matters while maintaining incident response effectiveness and legal compliance.

Proper HR coordination during security incidents helps to:

- Ensure compliance with employment laws and regulations
- Protect employee privacy rights during investigations
- Maintain proper evidence handling for potential disciplinary actions
- Provide clear communication channels between teams
- Support appropriate administrative actions when needed
- Document incidents properly for HR and security records

## Communication Protocols

### Initial Notification

When should HR be notified of an incident:

1. **Immediate Notification Required**
   - Confirmed insider threat incidents
   - Suspected data theft by employee
   - Workplace violence or threats
   - Severe violations of acceptable use policies
   - Incidents requiring employee access revocation

2. **Standard Notification (Within 24 Hours)**
   - Potential policy violations requiring investigation
   - Incidents where employee actions contributed to a security breach
   - Suspected minor acceptable use violations
   - Incidents requiring employee interviews
   - Situations needing employee access modifications

3. **Post-Resolution Notification (For Awareness)**
   - Minor incidents with employee involvement
   - Technical incidents with minimal employee impact
   - Incidents with lessons for employee training
   - Patterns of behavior requiring awareness

### Notification Process

1. **Initial Contact**
   - Use the incident response coordination system to notify HR
   - Include incident ID, basic details, and reason for HR involvement
   - Do not include full sensitive details in initial notification
   - Request appropriate HR representative based on incident type

2. **Secure Information Sharing**
   - Use approved secure communication channels
   - Follow information classification guidelines
   - Limit distribution to need-to-know personnel
   - Document all communications in the incident record

3. **Implementation Example**

```python
from admin.security.incident_response_kit.coordination import notify_stakeholders
from admin.security.incident_response_kit.incident_constants import IncidentSeverity

# Notify HR of an employee-related incident
hr_notification = notify_stakeholders(
    subject=f"HR Coordination Required: Incident {incident_id}",
    message=(
        "A security incident requiring HR coordination has been identified.\n\n"
        f"Incident ID: {incident_id}\n"
        f"Severity: {incident_severity}\n"
        f"Type: {incident_type}\n"
        "Employee involvement: Suspected policy violation\n\n"
        "Please respond to this notification to coordinate next steps."
    ),
    severity=IncidentSeverity.HIGH,
    incident_id=incident_id,
    recipients=["hr-security-liaison@example.com"],
    channels=["email"]
)

# Document HR notification in incident timeline
if hr_notification:
    from admin.security.incident_response_kit.coordination import update_incident_status

    update_incident_status(
        incident_id=incident_id,
        notes="HR team notified of incident requiring coordination.",
