## Overview

The reference materials provide essential information and guidelines that support incident responders throughout the incident lifecycle. These resources follow the NIST SP 800-61 incident handling framework and align with the organization's security policies and regulatory requirements. They serve as authoritative sources of information during incident response activities, ensuring that responders have access to accurate information, proper procedures, and up-to-date contact information.

## Usage Guidelines

### Contact List

The contact list is maintained in JSON format for programmatic access and contains all emergency contacts needed during incident response:

```json
// Example contact_list.json structure
{
  "incident_response_team": [
    {
      "role": "Incident Response Coordinator",
      "primary": {
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "email": "security-lead@example.com",
        "phone": "555-123-4567",
        "pager": "555-123-4567-911"
      },
      "secondary": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "security-backup@example.com",
        "phone": "555-123-4568",
        "pager": "555-123-4568-911"
      }
    }
  ],
  "external_resources": [
    {
      "organization": "Forensic Services Provider",
      "contact_name": "Forensic Team Lead",
      "phone": "555-987-6543",
      "email": "forensics@provider.com",
      "contract_id": "FS-2023-42",
      "availability": "24x7"
    }
  ],
  "regulatory_contacts": [
    // Regulatory authority contacts
  ],
  "law_enforcement": [
    // Law enforcement contacts
  ]
}
```

Access contact information programmatically:

```python
import json

# Load the contact list
with open('contact_list.json', 'r') as file:
    contacts = json.load(file)

# Get incident coordinator contact
coordinator = contacts['incident_response_team'][0]['primary']
print(f"Contacting Incident Coordinator: {coordinator['name']} at {coordinator['phone']}")
```

### Severity Classification

The severity classification guide helps determine the appropriate response level for incidents:

```bash
# Example of using the severity classification with the incident initialization script
../initialize.sh --incident-id IR-2023-042 \
    --severity high \
    --severity-guide references/severity_classification.md \
    --notify
```

### Evidence Collection

The evidence collection guide provides standardized procedures:

```bash
# Reference the evidence collection guide during evidence acquisition
../collect_evidence.py --incident-id IR-2023-042 \
    --hostname compromised-host-01 \
    --follow-guide references/evidence_collection_guide.md \
    --output /secure/evidence/IR-2023-042
```

## Best Practices & Security

- **Regular Updates**: Update all reference materials quarterly or after significant changes
- **Version Control**: Maintain all reference documents in version control
- **Access Control**: Ensure appropriate access controls for sensitive contact information
- **Verification**: Regularly verify all contact information for accuracy
- **Encryption**: Store sensitive contact information in encrypted format
- **Offline Copies**: Maintain offline copies of critical reference materials
- **Review Process**: Establish formal review process for all reference materials
- **Distribution Control**: Control distribution of reference materials with sensitive information
- **Training**: Include reference materials in incident response training
- **Format Consistency**: Maintain consistent formatting across all reference materials

## Common Features

All reference materials share these common features:

- **Version Information**: All documents include version number and last update date
- **Approval Status**: Documentation of approval status and approving authority
- **Review Schedule**: Clearly defined review and update schedule
- **Standardized Format**: Consistent formatting for easy navigation
- **Security Classification**: Clear marking of information sensitivity level
- **Cross-References**: Links to related documents and resources
- **Change Log**: Documentation of significant changes
- **Responsible Owner**: Clearly identified document owner
- **Legal Review**: Indication of legal review for applicable documents
- **Export Controls**: Notification of any applicable export control requirements
