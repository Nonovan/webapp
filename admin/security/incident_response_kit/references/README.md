## Usage Guidelines

### Contact List

The contact list is maintained in JSON format for programmatic access and contains all emergency contacts needed during incident response:

```json
// Example contact_list.json structure
{
  "incident_response_team": [
    {
      "role": "Incident Response Coordinator",
      "primary": {
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "email": "security-lead@example.com",
        "phone": "555-123-4567",
        "pager": "555-123-4567-911"
      },
      "secondary": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "security-backup@example.com",
        "phone": "555-123-4568",
        "pager": "555-123-4568-911"
      }
    }
  ],
  "external_resources": [
    {
      "organization": "Forensic Services Provider",
      "contact_name": "Forensic Team Lead",
      "phone": "555-987-6543",
      "email": "forensics@provider.com",
      "contract_id": "FS-2023-42",
      "availability": "24x7"
    }
  ],
  "regulatory_contacts": [
    // Regulatory authority contacts
  ],
  "law_enforcement": [
    // Law enforcement contacts
  ]
}
```

Access contact information programmatically:

```python
from admin.security.incident_response_kit import get_emergency_contact

# Get incident coordinator contact
coordinator = get_emergency_contact("incident_coordinator")
print(f"Contacting Incident Coordinator: {coordinator.name} at {coordinator.phone}")

# Alternatively, load the contact list directly
import json
with open('contact_list.json', 'r') as file:
    contacts = json.load(file)

# Get forensics provider contact
forensics = next((c for c in contacts['external_resources'] if c['organization'] == 'Forensic Services Provider'), None)
```

### Severity Classification

The severity classification guide helps determine the appropriate response level for incidents:

```bash
# Example of using the severity classification with the incident initialization script
../initialize.sh --incident-id IR-2023-042 \
    --severity high \
    --severity-guide references/severity_classification.md \
    --notify
```

Programmatic severity assessment:

```python
from admin.security.incident_response_kit import evaluate_incident_severity, IncidentSeverity

# Evaluate severity based on factors
severity = evaluate_incident_severity(
    data_sensitivity="confidential",
    system_criticality="high",
    affected_users=250,
    business_impact="moderate"
)

if severity >= IncidentSeverity.HIGH:
    # Implement high-severity response procedures
    notify_incident_management_team(severity=severity.name)
```

### Evidence Collection

The evidence collection guide provides standardized procedures:

```bash
# Reference the evidence collection guide during evidence acquisition
../collect_evidence.py --incident-id IR-2023-042 \
    --hostname compromised-host-01 \
    --follow-guide references/evidence_collection_guide.md \
    --output /secure/evidence/IR-2023-042
```

### DDoS Defense Reference

Access DDoS defense architecture and procedures:

```python
from admin.security.incident_response_kit import get_mitigation_strategy

# Get mitigation strategy for specific attack type
strategy = get_mitigation_strategy(
    attack_type="dns_amplification",
    traffic_volume="high",
    target_service="web_application"
)

print(f"Recommended filtering rules: {strategy.filtering_rules}")
print(f"Provider coordination steps: {strategy.provider_steps}")
```

### Privilege Escalation Reference

Access privilege escalation techniques for analysis:

```python
from admin.security.incident_response_kit import match_privilege_escalation_pattern

# Match observed behavior to known techniques
matches = match_privilege_escalation_pattern(
    observed_commands=["chmod u+s /bin/bash", "sudo -l"],
    file_modifications=["/etc/sudoers"],
    system_type="linux"
)

for technique in matches:
    print(f"Matched technique: {technique.name} - {technique.mitigation}")
```
