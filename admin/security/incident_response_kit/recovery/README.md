## Overview

The recovery tools provide structured methods for restoring services, validating system integrity, and implementing enhanced security controls following a security incident. These tools follow the NIST SP 800-61 incident handling framework, focusing specifically on the recovery phase to ensure systems are returned to normal operation in a secure manner with appropriate verification steps. The recovery process prioritizes security while minimizing business disruption.

## Usage Examples

### Security Hardening

Apply additional security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

```bash
# Apply security hardening based on incident findings
./security_hardening.sh --incident-id IR-2023-042 \
    --target web-app-01 --profile resources/hardening_profiles/web_server.json \
    --log-file /secure/evidence/IR-2023-042/hardening_web.log

# Apply targeted hardening to specific components
./security_hardening.sh --components "authentication,authorization" \
    --target api-server --apply-recommendations IR-2023-042 \
    --backup-configs

# Review and apply security recommendations from incident analysis
./security_hardening.sh --recommendations-file /secure/evidence/IR-2023-042/security_recommendations.json \
    --environment production --approval-required --notify security-team@example.com
```

### Service Restoration

Service restoration must be performed in a controlled, methodical manner to ensure security is maintained throughout the process.

```bash
# Restore core services in proper sequence with validation
./service_restoration.py --incident-id IR-2023-042 --environment production \
    --service web-application \
    --template resources/restoration_templates/web_application.json \
    --validate-each-step \
    --approval-required

# Restore a specific service with custom configuration
./service_restoration.py --incident-id IR-2023-042 --service database \
    --template resources/restoration_templates/database.json \
    --config-source /secure/backup/verified/db_config.json \
    --notify database-team@example.com

# Perform dry run to check restoration plan
./service_restoration.py --incident-id IR-2023-042 --service api-service \
    --template resources/restoration_templates/api_service.json \
    --environment staging \
    --dry-run --verbose
```

### System Verification

After service restoration, thorough verification ensures systems are secure and functioning properly.

```bash
# Generate verification checklist for a web application server
./resources/verification_scripts/generate_checklist.py --system-type web-server \
    --output /secure/evidence/IR-2023-042/web_verification_checklist.md

# Run automated verification suite
./resources/verification_scripts/run_verification.sh --system web-app-01 \
    --checklist /secure/evidence/IR-2023-042/web_verification_checklist.md \
    --report /secure/evidence/IR-2023-042/verification_results.json

# Verify security controls are properly enabled
./resources/verification_scripts/security_controls.py --system database-01 \
    --baseline /secure/baselines/database_security_baseline.json \
    --report /secure/evidence/IR-2023-042/db_security_verification.pdf
```

## Best Practices & Security

- **Approval Workflow**: Implement approval requirements for critical restoration steps
- **Clean Source Principle**: Restore from verified clean sources only
- **Defense in Depth**: Apply multiple security controls rather than relying on a single measure
- **Documentation**: Document all recovery steps taken for the incident record
- **Independent Verification**: Have a second analyst verify critical security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Restore services with minimal required privileges and add permissions incrementally
- **Monitoring Enhancement**: Implement additional monitoring for recently recovered systems
- **Progressive Recovery**: Restore systems incrementally, starting with core infrastructure
- **Security Testing**: Perform security testing after recovery before returning to full production
- **Verification at Each Step**: Verify security and functionality at each restoration stage

## Common Features

The recovery tools share these common features:

- **Approval Workflows**: Support for required approvals at critical steps
- **Chain of Custody**: Maintenance of proper chain of custody for all evidence
- **Compliance Documentation**: Automatic generation of documentation for compliance requirements
- **Detailed Logging**: All operations are logged for audit and documentation purposes
- **Evidence Preservation**: Preservation of incident evidence throughout recovery
- **Failure Handling**: Graceful handling of failures during recovery with clear error reporting
- **Integration with Other Components**: Seamless integration with other incident response tools
- **Metrics Tracking**: Collection of metrics on recovery time and effectiveness
- **Notification System**: Automated notifications at key recovery stages
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Ability to roll back changes if issues occur during recovery
