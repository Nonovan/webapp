## Overview

The evidence analysis documentation templates provide structured formats for documenting the technical examination of collected evidence during security incident investigations. These templates standardize the approach to documenting forensic findings while maintaining proper evidence handling procedures and chain of custody. They help ensure that analysis is conducted and documented in a forensically sound manner that preserves evidence integrity and admissibility in legal proceedings.

## Usage

These templates are designed to be used by forensic analysts when documenting evidence analysis:

```bash
# Copy a template to a case-specific evidence directory
cp admin/security/forensics/templates/evidence_handling/analysis_docs/evidence_examination.md \
   /secure/evidence/case-2024-042/evidence/E001/examination.md

# Generate an analysis report using data extraction results
../../../utils/report_builder.py \
   --extraction-results /secure/evidence/case-2024-042/evidence/E001/extraction_results.json \
   --template data_extraction_report.md \
   --output /secure/evidence/case-2024-042/evidence/E001/extraction_report.md \
   --case-id "case-2024-042" \
   --evidence-id "E001" \
   --analyst "Jane Smith"
```

## Template Variables

The templates use standardized variables that are replaced during document generation:

### Common Variables

- `{{document_id}}` - Unique document identifier
- `{{evidence_id}}` - Related evidence identifier
- `{{acquisition_date}}` - Date evidence was acquired
- `{{examination_date}}` - Date evidence was examined

### Evidence Examination Variables

- `{{evidence_description}}` - Description of the evidence item
- `{{evidence_type}}` - Type of evidence being examined
- `{{hash_algorithm}}` - Hash algorithm used for verification
- `{{original_hash}}` - Original acquisition hash value
- `{{verification_hash}}` - Verification hash value
- `{{chain_of_custody_ref}}` - Reference to chain of custody document
- `{{examination_environment}}` - Evidence examination environment
- `{{write_protection_method}}` - Write protection method used

### Forensic Image Variables

- `{{image_format}}` - Format of forensic image
- `{{imaging_tool}}` - Tool used to create the image
- `{{partition_table}}` - Partition table information
- `{{filesystem_types}}` - Types of filesystems identified
- `{{total_sectors}}` - Total sectors in the image

- `{{extraction_filters}}` - Filters applied during extraction
- `{{legal_authority}}` - Legal authority for extraction
- `{{scope_limitations}}` - Scope limitations for extraction

## Customization Guidelines

When customizing these templates for specific evidence analysis:

1. **Maintain Evidentiary Standards**
   - Document all steps to maintain evidence integrity
   - Verify and document hash values at each stage
   - Record all tools and commands used
   - Document chain of custody throughout analysis
   - Note any potential alterations to the evidence

2. **Add Analysis-Specific Details**
   - Document specific methodologies employed
   - Include tool configurations and versions
   - Document significant findings with references
   - Include screenshots of significant findings
   - Maintain chronological documentation of analysis steps

3. **Follow Legal and Procedural Requirements**
   - Document compliance with legal requirements
   - Note scope limitations and authorizations
   - Document presence of potentially privileged material
   - Record any exclusions from analysis
   - Note any deviations from standard procedures

4. **Ensure Proper Verification**
   - Document verification of findings by second analyst
   - Include reviewer information and comments
   - Document any disputed interpretations
   - Note confidence levels for findings
   - Document limitations of analysis techniques

## Best Practices & Security

- **Chain of Custody**: Maintain and document chain of custody throughout analysis
- **Hash Verification**: Verify evidence integrity using cryptographic hashes
- **Write Protection**: Document write protection methods used during analysis
- **Sterile Environment**: Use and document forensically sound examination environments
- **Tool Documentation**: Document all tools, versions, and commands used
- **Time Synchronization**: Ensure and document time synchronization in examination environment
