## Overview

The Forensic Analysis Toolkit provides tools for collecting, preserving, and analyzing digital evidence during security incident investigations. These tools follow proper evidence handling procedures to ensure findings can be used for internal investigation, remediation, and in legal proceedings if necessary.

## Key Components

- **`collect_evidence.py`**: Evidence collection script for security incidents
  - Securely captures system state, memory, and logs
  - Creates forensic images with hash verification
  - Establishes chain of custody for collected evidence
  - Documents all collection procedures automatically

- **`analyze_memory.py`**: Memory forensics utility
  - Analyzes process memory dumps for malicious artifacts
  - Identifies suspicious processes and connections
  - Detects hidden processes and rootkits
  - Extracts strings and artifacts from memory

- **`disk_forensics.py`**: Disk analysis toolkit
  - File system timeline analysis
  - Deleted file recovery
  - Hidden data detection
  - Artifact identification and extraction

- **`network_capture.py`**: Network traffic analysis tools
  - Packet capture with filtering options
  - Traffic pattern analysis
  - Protocol analysis and reconstruction
  - Malicious traffic identification

- **`timeline_builder.py`**: Investigation timeline creation
  - Aggregates events from multiple sources
  - Creates chronological view of incidents
  - Correlates log entries across systems
  - Exports timelines in various formats

- **`malware_analysis.sh`**: Isolated malware analysis environment
  - Static analysis of suspicious files
  - Behavioral analysis in sandboxed environment
  - Hash comparison with known malware
  - Reporting of indicators of compromise

- **`chain_of_custody.py`**: Evidence handling documentation
  - Creates and maintains chain of custody records
  - Tracks all access to evidence
  - Generates legally-sound documentation
  - Ensures evidence integrity verification

```

## Configuration

The forensic toolkit uses configuration files to ensure consistent operation:

```json
// collection_config.json
{
  "evidence_output_dir": "/secure/forensics/evidence",
  "hash_algorithms": ["sha256", "sha1"],
  "default_memory_capture": true,
  "network_capture_timeout": 300,
  "sensitive_data_handling": "encrypt",
  "encryption_key_path": "/secure/keys/forensic.key",
  "log_level": "info",
  "max_disk_space_gb": 50,
  "preserve_file_timestamps": true,
  "automated_chain_custody": true
}
```

## Security Features

- **Evidence Integrity**: All collected evidence is hashed with SHA-256 to verify integrity
- **Chain of Custody**: Comprehensive chain of custody tracking from collection to analysis
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access restrictions for forensic tools and evidence
- **Secure Storage**: Encryption of sensitive artifacts and evidence
- **Audit Logging**: Detailed logging of all forensic activities for verification
- **Memory Protection**: Safeguards against memory contamination during acquisition
- **Anti-Tampering**: Detection of evidence tampering attempts
- **Isolation**: Options for network isolation during evidence collection
- **Data Sanitization**: Removal of sensitive data from reports when needed
- **Read-Only Operations**: Default use of read-only tools to preserve evidence

## Usage Examples

### Evidence Collection

```bash
# Collect evidence from a compromised system
./collect_evidence.py --hostname compromised-host-01 \
    --memory-capture \
    --process-list \
    --network-connections \
    --log-window 24h \
    --output /secure/evidence/incident-42
```

### Memory Analysis

```bash
# Analyze memory dump for signs of compromise
./analyze_memory.py --memory-dump /secure/evidence/incident-42/memory.dmp \
    --detect-injections \
    --scan-signatures \
    --extract-strings \
    --output-report /secure/evidence/incident-42/memory-analysis.pdf
```

### Malware Analysis

```bash
# Run suspicious file in isolated environment
./malware_analysis.sh --file /secure/evidence/incident-42/suspicious.exe \
    --sandbox-time 5m \
    --network-simulation \
    --dump-behavior \
    --output /secure/evidence/incident-42/malware-analysis
```

### Timeline Creation

```bash
# Generate incident timeline from multiple sources
./timeline_builder.py --incident-id 42 \
    --auth-logs /secure/evidence/incident-42/auth.log \
    --web-logs /secure/evidence/incident-42/nginx/ \
    --firewall-logs /secure/evidence/incident-42/firewall/ \
    --output /secure/evidence/incident-42/timeline.json \
    --format json,csv
```
