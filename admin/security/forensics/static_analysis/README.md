## Overview

The static analysis tools provide non-invasive examination capabilities for digital artifacts collected during security incidents. These tools analyze file structure, content, signatures, and characteristics to identify malicious code, suspicious patterns, and potential threats without executing the files. This approach enables safe handling of potentially dangerous artifacts while extracting valuable forensic insights.

- **`file_analyzer.py`**: Comprehensive file structure analysis
  - File format identification and validation
  - File structure parsing and visualization
  - Embedded object detection and extraction
  - Metadata extraction and analysis
  - String extraction with pattern matching
  - Entropy analysis for encryption/obfuscation detection

- **`signature_checker.py`**: File signature verification and analysis
  - Known malware signature checking
  - YARA rule-based pattern matching
  - Code signing verification
  - Digital signature validation
  - Heuristic-based detection of suspicious patterns
  - File type verification against declared format

- **`hash_compare.py`**: Hash-based file analysis and comparison
  - Multi-algorithm hash calculation (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SSDEEP)
  - Known-bad hash comparison against threat intelligence
  - File integrity verification
  - Similar file identification through fuzzy hashing
  - Binary similarity analysis
  - Historical hash comparison for change detection

- **`memory_string_analyzer.py`**: Analysis of strings extracted from memory dumps
  - Command line parameter extraction
  - URL and IP address identification
  - Crypto key pattern detection
  - Suspicious API call sequence detection

./file_analyzer.py --file /secure/evidence/incident-42/suspicious.exe \
    --extract-strings \
    --extract-resources \
    --entropy-analysis \
    --output /secure/evidence/incident-42/analysis/file_analysis.json

# Analyze specific sections of a PE file
./file_analyzer.py --file /secure/evidence/incident-42/suspicious.exe \
    --pe-sections --section-entropy \
    --output /secure/evidence/incident-42/analysis/pe_sections.json

# Extract embedded files from document
./file_analyzer.py --file /secure/evidence/incident-42/document.docx \
    --extract-embedded \
    --output-dir /secure/evidence/incident-42/analysis/embedded_files/
```

### Signature Checking

```bash
# Check file against known malware signatures
./signature_checker.py --file /secure/evidence/incident-42/suspicious.exe \
    --check-signatures \
    --output /secure/evidence/incident-42/analysis/signature_check.json

## Security Features

- **Sandbox Execution**: All tools operate in restricted environments to prevent accidental execution
- **Integrity Protection**: Evidence files are opened in read-only mode to preserve integrity
- **Chain of Custody**: All operations are logged with timestamps and analyst information
- **Evidence Hashing**: Files are hashed before and after analysis to verify integrity
- **Secure Output Handling**: Analysis results are stored with appropriate access controls
- **Memory Protection**: Tools implement memory protection to prevent code execution
- **Resource Limits**: Processing has strict resource limits to prevent denial of service
- **Secure Cleanup**: Memory and temporary files are securely wiped after processing
- **Privilege Separation**: Tools run with minimal required privileges
- **Input Validation**: All file inputs and parameters are validated before processing

## Integration

These static analysis tools integrate with other components of the forensic toolkit:

- Results can be used as input for the `timeline_builder.py` to establish incident chronology
- Hash information can be shared with `threat_intelligence.py` for threat context
- Analysis findings can be included in reports generated by `report_generator.py`
- Extracted IOCs can be added to detection systems via `ioc_manager.py`
- Suspicious files can be escalated to dynamic analysis in isolated environments
- Integration with `malware_classification.py` for automated malware family identification
- Findings can be correlated with `network_traffic_analyzer.py` to identify command and control patterns
- Results feed into `incident_risk_scorer.py` for overall incident risk assessment
