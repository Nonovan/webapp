## Usage

The common components are designed to be imported and used by the static analysis tools:

```python
from admin.security.forensics.static_analysis.common import file_utils, hash_utils
from admin.security.forensics.static_analysis.common.yara_rules import YaraScanner
from admin.security.forensics.static_analysis.common.signature_db import SignatureDBManager

# File analysis
file_type = file_utils.identify_file_type('/path/to/suspicious_file')
file_metadata = file_utils.extract_metadata_by_format('/path/to/suspicious_file')

# Hash calculation
hashes = hash_utils.calculate_multiple_hashes(
    '/path/to/suspicious_file',
    algorithms=['md5', 'sha1', 'sha256', 'ssdeep']
)

# Signature verification
db_manager = SignatureDBManager()
signature_matches = db_manager.check_file_signatures('/path/to/suspicious_file')

# YARA scanning
scanner = YaraScanner(
    rule_paths=[
        "admin/security/forensics/static_analysis/common/yara_rules/malware",
        "admin/security/forensics/static_analysis/common/yara_rules/suspicious"
    ]
)
yara_matches = scanner.scan_file('/path/to/suspicious_file')
```

## Security Features

- **Secure File Handling**: All file operations use proper permissions and secure access methods
- **Integrity Verification**: Evidence files are validated with hash checks before and after operations
- **Memory Protection**: Implements memory-safe operations to prevent execution of malicious code
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Uses conservative defaults requiring explicit opt-in for intensive operations
- **Input Validation**: All input parameters are validated before use
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with secure error reporting
- **Resource Limits**: Implements safeguards against resource exhaustion
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Components operate with minimal required permissions
- **Sandbox Execution**: Analysis is performed in restricted environments to prevent execution
- **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged for security and forensic verification

## Best Practices

When using these common components:

1. **File Handling**
   - Always use `file_utils` for file operations instead of direct Python I/O
   - Validate file paths before access to prevent path traversal issues
   - Use read-only access when possible to preserve evidence integrity
   - Implement proper error handling for all file operations

2. **Hash Verification**
   - Generate hashes before and after operations to verify integrity
   - Use multiple hash algorithms for comprehensive verification
   - Store hash values with evidence for future validation
   - Compare hashes against known malware databases

3. **Signature Analysis**
   - Regularly update signature databases to detect latest threats
   - Use multiple signature sources for better coverage
   - Document signature matches in analysis reports
   - Understand signature confidence levels for proper analysis

4. **YARA Rules**
   - Combine multiple YARA rules for more accurate detection
   - Optimize rules to prevent performance degradation
   - Handle rule exceptions properly to prevent analysis failure
   - Regularly update rules with emerging threat patterns

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - Use appropriate rule subsets for specific analysis types
   - Implement timeouts for all operations to prevent hanging
   - Process large files in chunks to manage memory consumption
   - Use appropriate parallelization for performance optimization
