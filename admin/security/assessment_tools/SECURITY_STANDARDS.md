## Overview

The security assessment tools are designed to validate system configurations, identify vulnerabilities, verify security controls, and assess compliance with security standards. These tools must adhere to stringent security requirements to ensure they do not introduce security risks or operational issues while performing their functions.

## Compliance Frameworks

The assessment tools support evaluation against the following compliance frameworks:

| Framework | Version | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| CIS Benchmarks | Various | System hardening guidelines for different platforms |
| DISA STIGs | Various | Security Technical Implementation Guides |
| GDPR | 2016/679 | European data protection and privacy requirements |
| HIPAA | 1996 + Updates | Healthcare information security requirements |
| ISO 27001 | 2013 | Information security management standard |
| NIST CSF | 1.1 | Cybersecurity Framework core functions |
| NIST SP 800-53 | Rev. 5 | Security controls for federal information systems |
| OWASP ASVS | 4.0 | Application Security Verification Standard |
| PCI DSS | 4.0 | Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard |
| SOC 2 Type II | 2017 | Trust Service Criteria |

## Security Assessment Methodology

All security assessments conducted with these tools must follow the defined methodology:

1. **Planning**: Define scope, objectives, and constraints
2. **Discovery**: Identify systems and assets within scope
3. **Assessment**: Evaluate security controls against applicable baselines
4. **Analysis**: Analyze findings and determine risk levels
5. **Reporting**: Document findings, risks, and remediation recommendations
6. **Remediation**: Track and verify remediation activities
7. **Verification**: Confirm effectiveness of implemented controls

## Tool Security Requirements

### Minimum Security Standards

1. **Authentication**: All tools must authenticate users before execution
2. **Authorization**: Tools must enforce role-based access control
3. **Secure Defaults**: Conservative defaults requiring explicit opt-in for invasive operations
4. **Input Validation**: All inputs must be validated before processing
5. **Output Sanitization**: Output must be sanitized to prevent information disclosure
6. **Audit Logging**: All tool operations must be logged for accountability
7. **Error Handling**: Secure error handling to prevent information leakage
8. **Resource Protection**: Rate limiting and resource quotas to prevent abuse

### Security Controls

- **Access Control**: Enforce least privilege principles for all operations
- **Configuration Management**: Version-controlled secure configurations
- **Data Protection**: Encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Integrity Verification**: Hash verification for assessment data
- **Network Security**: Restricted network access and secure communications
- **Safe Execution**: Non-destructive assessment methods by default

## Data Handling Standards

### Data Classification

| Classification | Description | Handling Requirements |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Public | Non-sensitive information | No special handling required |
| Internal | Non-sensitive but not public information | Store within controlled environment |
| Confidential | Sensitive information | Encryption and access controls required |
| Restricted | Highly sensitive information | Encryption, access controls, audit logging required |

### Evidence Handling

1. **Collection**: Evidence must be collected using secure, documented methods
2. **Storage**: Evidence must be stored with appropriate encryption and access controls
3. **Chain of Custody**: All evidence handling must maintain proper chain of custody
4. **Retention**: Evidence must be retained according to data retention policies
5. **Disposal**: Evidence must be securely disposed when no longer needed

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Requirements

1. **Identity Verification**: All tool users must be authenticated before use
2. **Privileged Actions**: Administrative functions require multi-factor authentication
3. **Non-interactive Access**: Service accounts must use certificate-based authentication
4. **Authentication Strength**: Authentication mechanisms must align with access level

### Authorization Model

1. **Role-Based Access**: Access to assessment tools and results based on role
2. **Separation of Duties**: Different roles for assessment execution and result management
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions needed for each operation
4. **Just-in-Time Access**: Temporary elevated access for specific operations

### Standard Roles

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Security Analyst | Conducts assessments and analyzes results | Execute assessments, view results, create reports |
| Security Engineer | Develops and maintains assessment tools | Configure tools, develop rules, maintain baselines |
| Security Administrator | Manages assessment infrastructure | Manage user access, configure global settings |
| Auditor | Reviews assessment processes and results | View results, audit logs, and configurations |

## Assessment Execution Standards

### Execution Requirements

1. **Authorization**: Obtain proper authorization before conducting assessments
2. **Change Management**: Follow change management procedures for invasive tests
3. **Notification**: Notify stakeholders before conducting assessments
4. **Scheduling**: Schedule assessments during approved maintenance windows
5. **Coordination**: Coordinate with system owners and operations teams
6. **Monitoring**: Monitor system health during assessment execution
7. **Safe Testing**: Use non-invasive methods unless explicitly authorized otherwise

### Risk Management

1. **Risk Assessment**: Assess risks before executing invasive tests
2. **Mitigation Planning**: Develop mitigation plans for identified risks
3. **Rollback Capability**: Maintain ability to restore systems to pre-assessment state
4. **Incident Response**: Prepare for potential incidents during assessment

|----------|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0 | Poses an immediate threat, exploitable with significant impact | 7 days |
| High | 7.0 - 8.9 | Significant risk, relatively easy to exploit | 30 days |
| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 | Moderate risk, requires specific conditions | 90 days |
| Low | 0.1 - 3.9 | Limited impact or difficult to exploit | 180 days |
