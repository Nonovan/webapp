## Overview

The monitoring directory contains specialized security monitoring tools for administrative use. These tools provide enhanced visibility into security events, support incident investigation, and enable proactive threat detection beyond what's available in the standard monitoring system (monitoring). They are designed for security operations personnel and incident responders.

## Key Components

- **`security_dashboard.py`**: Administrative security dashboard generator
  - Real-time security posture visualization
  - Threat intelligence integration
  - Incident tracking and management
  - Anomaly detection visualization
  - Security metrics tracking

- **`integrity_monitor.sh`**: Enhanced file integrity monitoring system
  - Critical file monitoring beyond standard system checks
  - Administrative configuration integrity verification
  - Cryptographic verification of system binaries
  - Detection of unauthorized file modifications
  - Rootkit and backdoor detection capabilities

- **`threat_intelligence.py`**: Threat intelligence integration tool
  - IOC (Indicators of Compromise) matching
  - Threat feed integration and management
  - IP reputation analysis and alerting
  - Known malicious pattern detection
  - Automated blocklist updates

- **`security_event_correlator.py`**: Security event correlation engine
  - Cross-system event analysis
  - Attack pattern recognition
  - Advanced persistent threat detection
  - Sequential attack detection
  - Baseline deviation alerting

- **`privilege_audit.py`**: Administrative privilege monitoring
  - Privileged account usage tracking
  - Permission escalation detection
  - Administrative action verification
  - Unexpected privilege changes
  - Role-based access control validation

- **`anomaly_detector.sh`**: Behavioral anomaly detection system
  - User behavior analytics
  - System call pattern analysis
  - Network traffic anomaly detection
  - Resource usage pattern monitoring
  - Machine learning-based anomaly detection

```

## Configuration

The security monitoring tools use configuration files in the config directory:

```json
// threat_feeds.json
{
  "feeds": [
    {
      "name": "EmergingThreats",
      "url": "https://rules.emergingthreats.net/blockrules/compromised-ips.txt",
      "type": "ip_list",
      "update_interval": 86400,
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "name": "AlienVaultOTX",
      "api_key": "${OTX_API_KEY}",
      "url": "https://otx.alienvault.com/api/v1/indicators/export",
      "type": "structured",
      "update_interval": 43200,
      "enabled": true
    }
  ],
  "local_cache_dir": "/var/cache/cloud-platform/threat_intel",
  "retention_days": 90,
  "match_threshold": 0.75
}
```

## Security Features

- **Access Controls**: Only authorized security personnel can access these tools
- **Secure Credential Handling**: API keys and credentials are securely managed
- **Audit Logging**: All actions are logged for security accountability
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs and external data are validated
- **Secure Output Handling**: Sensitive information is properly protected in reports
- **Integrity Protection**: Self-verification mechanisms prevent tampering
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects against API abuse and resource exhaustion
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for tool access
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Need-to-Know Basis**: Information is compartmentalized based on roles

## Usage Examples

### Security Dashboard Generation

```bash
# Generate a comprehensive security dashboard
./security_dashboard.py --environment production --output /var/www/security/dashboard.html

# Generate a focused dashboard for a specific incident
./security_dashboard.py --incident-id INC-2023-42 --detail-level high
```

### File Integrity Verification

```bash
# Perform comprehensive integrity check
./integrity_monitor.sh --scan-all --verify-signatures

# Check only critical configuration files
./integrity_monitor.sh --scope config-files --alert-on-change
```

### Threat Intelligence Integration

```bash
# Update threat intelligence from all feeds
./threat_intelligence.py --update-all

# Check specific indicators against threat intelligence
./threat_intelligence.py --check-ioc "185.159.128.243" --type ip
```

### Security Event Correlation

```bash
# Analyze events from the past 24 hours
./security_event_correlator.py --hours 24 --correlation-window 300

# Analyze events related to a specific user
./security_event_correlator.py --user-id 42 --detection-mode aggressive
```
