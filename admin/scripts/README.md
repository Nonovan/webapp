## Overview

The administrative scripts provide command-line tools for performing critical administrative functions, security operations, and system management tasks. These scripts are designed for system administrators who need to perform security audits, manage emergency access, control privileges, validate system health, and implement system lockdown procedures. All scripts implement appropriate security controls, including authentication, authorization, and comprehensive logging of all actions.

- **`emergency_access.py`**: Emergency access management system
  - Break-glass account activation
  - Temporary privilege escalation
  - Emergency access approval workflow
  - Time-limited access controls
  - Automated notifications for emergency access
  - Detailed audit logging of all emergency access

- **`privilege_management.sh`**: Privilege control management
  - Role-based access control management
  - Permission assignment and revocation

- **`backup_verification.sh`**: Backup integrity verification
  - Validates the integrity of system and database backups
  - Ensures recoverability of critical data
  - Generates detailed verification reports

- **`compliance_report_generator.py`**: Compliance reporting tool
  - Generates compliance reports for standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, and ISO 27001
  - Maps system configurations to compliance requirements
  - Supports multiple output formats (PDF, JSON, HTML)

- **`incident_response.sh`**: Incident response automation
  - Automates key steps in incident response workflows
  - Collects forensic evidence
  - Isolates compromised systems
  - Notifies relevant stakeholders

- **`security_baseline_validator.py`**: Security baseline validation tool
  - Validates system configurations against predefined security baselines
  - Identifies deviations and provides remediation recommendations
  - Supports environment-specific baselines

- **`system_health_check.sh`**: System health monitoring script
  - Performs comprehensive health checks on system components
  - Monitors resource usage, service status, and security configurations
  - Generates health reports for administrators

## Usage

### Administrative Auditing

```bash
# Generate comprehensive audit report
python admin_audit.py --report-format pdf --output audit-report.pdf

# Audit specific user's administrative actions
python admin_audit.py --user admin.username --days 30 --action-type configuration_change

# Find anomalies in administrative actions
python admin_audit.py --detect-anomalies --threshold medium --notify security@example.com
```

### Emergency Access Management

```bash
# Activate emergency access (requires approval)
python emergency_access.py --activate --role admin --reason "Critical system failure" --duration 4h

# Approve pending emergency access request
python emergency_access.py --approve --request-id ER-2023-042 --approver security.admin

# Deactivate emergency access before expiration
python emergency_access.py --deactivate --request-id ER-2023-042 --reason "Issue resolved"
```

### Privilege Management

```bash
# Grant temporary privileges to a user
./privilege_management.sh --grant --user jsmith --role system:admin --duration 2h --reason "Deployment support"

# Review all users with elevated privileges
./privilege_management.sh --list-privileged --output-format json > privileged_users.json

# Revoke specific permission
./privilege_management.sh --revoke --user jsmith --permission "config:write" --reason "No longer required"
```

### System Security

```bash
# Perform system security lockdown
./system_lockdown.sh --environment production --security-level high

# Apply targeted security controls
./system_lockdown.sh --component authentication --apply-policy strict-mfa

# Verify security controls are properly implemented
./system_lockdown.sh --verify --policy-file security-baseline.json
```

### Health and Compliance

```bash
# Validate system health
./system_health_check.sh --output health-report.json

# Verify backup integrity
./backup_verification.sh --env production --backup-file backup_20231101.tar.gz

# Generate compliance report
python compliance_report_generator.py --standard pci-dss --output compliance-report.pdf
```

## Best Practices & Security

- **Access Control**: Run all scripts with appropriate administrative credentials.
- **Audit Trail**: All script actions are comprehensively logged for accountability.
- **Authorization**: Critical operations require appropriate approval workflows.
- **Change Management**: Follow change control procedures for production environments.
- **Documentation**: Document all non-routine operations with justification.
- **Expiration**: Set appropriate timeframes for temporary access grants.
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions for required tasks.
- **Review**: Regularly review audit logs and privilege assignments.
- **Testing**: Test scripts in development/staging before using in production.
- **Two-Person Rule**: Implement dual control for critical security operations.

## Common Features

All administrative scripts share these common features:

- **Authentication**: Integration with platform authentication system.
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained permission checks for all operations.
- **Command Validation**: Thorough validation of all parameters.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed audit logs of all actions.
- **Confirmation Prompts**: Verification for destructive operations.
- **Documentation**: Built-in help system with examples.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of failures with clear messages.
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Environment-specific configurations.
- **Secure Defaults**: Conservative security defaults requiring explicit opt-out.
- **Version Information**: Clear version tracking for all scripts.
