# Cloud Infrastructure Management Platform

## Overview

Welcome to the Cloud Infrastructure Management Platform documentation. This comprehensive Flask-based application provides secure management, monitoring, and analytics for cloud infrastructure with integrated industrial control systems (ICS) support.

This documentation will help you install, configure, and use the platform effectively while maintaining security best practices.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/username/cloud-platform.git
cd cloud-platform

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your configuration

# Initialize the database
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade

# Create initial admin user
flask create-admin

# Run development server
flask run
```

### Configuration

The platform uses a hierarchical configuration system with these sources (in order of precedence):
1. Environment variables
2. .env file variables
3. Default configuration values

Key configuration options:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Flask secret key for session security | *required* |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection string | `sqlite:///app.db` |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection for caching & sessions | `redis://localhost:6379/0` |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | Secret for JWT token generation | *required* |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Application environment | `development` |
| `CLOUD_PROVIDERS_ENABLED` | Enable cloud provider integrations | `True` |

## API Reference

See the API Reference documentation for detailed information about the available API endpoints.

## Security Features

- Content Security Policy (CSP) with nonce-based script validation
- CSRF protection for all forms and API endpoints
- Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks for static assets
- Secure cookie handling and session management
- Password security with strength requirements and history checks
- Input validation and sanitization against XSS and injection attacks

## Webhook System

The platform includes a webhook system allowing external systems to receive real-time notifications about events:

| Event Category | Description | Examples |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Cloud Resources | Resource lifecycle events | `resource.created`, `resource.updated` |
| Alerts | Alert state changes | `alert.triggered`, `alert.resolved` |
| Security | Security-related events | `security.incident`, `security.scan.completed` |
| ICS | Industrial control system events | `ics.reading`, `ics.state.change` |
| System | Platform system events | `system.backup.completed` |

For detailed documentation on using webhooks, see the Webhook Reference.
