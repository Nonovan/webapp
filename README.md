# Cloud Infrastructure Management Platform Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to the Cloud Infrastructure Management Platform documentation. This comprehensive Flask-based application provides secure management, monitoring, and analytics for cloud infrastructure with integrated industrial control systems (ICS) support.

This documentation will help you install, configure, and use the platform effectively while maintaining security best practices.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/username/cloud-platform.git
cd cloud-platform

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your configuration

# Initialize the database
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade

# Create initial admin user
flask create-admin

# Run development server
flask run
```

### Configuration

The platform uses a hierarchical configuration system with these sources (in order of precedence):
1. Environment variables
2. .env file variables
3. Default configuration values

Key configuration options:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Flask secret key for session security | *required* |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection string | `sqlite:///app.db` |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection for caching & sessions | `redis://localhost:6379/0` |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | Secret for JWT token generation | *required* |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Application environment | `development` |
| `CLOUD_PROVIDERS_ENABLED` | Enable cloud provider integrations | `True` |

## Core Features

### Cloud Resource Management

The platform supports multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and allows you to:

- **Provision Resources**: Create virtual machines, storage, and network resources
- **Monitor Performance**: Track CPU, memory, and network metrics in real-time
- **Manage Lifecycle**: Start, stop, restart, and terminate resources
- **Track Costs**: Monitor and optimize cloud spending

### Security & Compliance

Built with security in mind, the platform includes:

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions for users and groups
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enhanced login security
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all user actions
- **File Integrity Monitoring**: Detection of unauthorized file modifications

### Monitoring & Alerts

Stay informed about your infrastructure with:

- **Real-Time Dashboards**: Visual representation of system metrics
- **Anomaly Detection**: ML-based identification of unusual patterns
- **Alert Management**: Configurable notifications across multiple channels
- **Historical Analysis**: Long-term trend visualization and reporting

### Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Integration

Connect and monitor industrial systems:

- **Environmental Controls**: Monitor temperature, humidity, and air quality
- **Device Management**: Track and control ICS devices
- **Secure Controls**: Role-based access to physical systems
- **Historical Data**: Long-term storage of ICS metrics

## API Reference

The platform provides a comprehensive RESTful API for integrating with other systems:

```
/api/auth/      - Authentication endpoints
/api/cloud/     - Cloud resource management
/api/metrics/   - Metrics collection and retrieval
/api/alerts/    - Alert configuration and management
/api/ics/       - Industrial control systems integration
```

All API endpoints are secured with JWT authentication and support rate limiting.

## Security Considerations

The platform implements numerous security features:

- **Content Security Policy**: Prevents XSS attacks
- **CSRF Protection**: Secures all form submissions
- **Secure Cookies**: Protects session data
- **Input Validation**: Prevents injection attacks
- **Password Security**: Enforces strong password policies
- **Regular Security Updates**: Maintained dependency versions

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Database Connection Errors**: Verify your DATABASE_URL is correct and the database server is running.

2. **Redis Connection Issues**: Ensure Redis is running and accessible at the configured REDIS_URL.

3. **Cloud Provider Authentication Failures**: Verify your cloud provider credentials are correct and have appropriate permissions.

4. **Performance Issues**: Check system resources, database query performance, and Redis cache hit rates.

For additional help, check the application logs in the `logs/` directory or enable debug mode during development.
