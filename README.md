# Cloud Infrastructure Management Platform

## Overview

The Cloud Infrastructure Management Platform is a comprehensive Flask-based application that provides secure management, monitoring, and analytics for cloud infrastructure with integrated industrial control systems (ICS) support. The platform is designed with security as a core principle and supports multi-cloud environments.

This documentation will help you install, configure, and use the platform effectively while maintaining security best practices.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <https://github.com/username/cloud-platform.git>
cd cloud-platform

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your configuration

# Initialize the database
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade

# Create initial admin user
flask create-admin

# Run development server
flask run

```

### Configuration

The platform uses a hierarchical configuration system with these sources (in order of precedence):

1. Environment variables
2. .env file variables
3. Default configuration values

Key configuration options:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Flask secret key for session security | *required* |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection string | `sqlite:///app.db` |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection for caching & sessions | `redis://localhost:6379/0` |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | Secret for JWT token generation | *required* |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Application environment | `development` |
| `CLOUD_PROVIDERS_ENABLED` | Enable cloud provider integrations | `True` |

See the environment example files in environments for a comprehensive list of configuration options.

### Deployment

For production deployment, follow the documentation in the deployment directory:

```bash
# Set up production configuration
cp deployment/environments/production.env.example deployment/environments/production.env
# Edit production.env with your production settings

# Deploy using the deployment script
cd deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh production

```

Refer to [README.md](http://readme.md/) for detailed deployment instructions.

## Architecture

The platform is built with a modular architecture that emphasizes security, scalability, and maintainability:

- **Frontend**: Modern responsive UI with Bootstrap 5 and JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python 3 with Flask framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching/queues
- **API**: RESTful API with comprehensive documentation and SDK libraries
- **Security**: Defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers
