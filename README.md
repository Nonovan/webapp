## Overview

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform is a comprehensive Flask-based application that provides secure management, monitoring, and analytics for cloud infrastructure with integrated industrial control systems (ICS) support. The platform is designed with security as a core principle and supports multi-cloud environments including AWS, Azure, and GCP.

This platform enables organizations to centralize cloud resource management, enforce security policies, monitor system health, and respond to incidents across their entire infrastructure through a unified interface.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/username/cloud-platform.git
cd cloud-platform

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your configuration

# Initialize the database
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade

# Create initial admin user
flask create-admin

# Run development server
flask run
```

### Configuration

The platform uses a hierarchical configuration system with these sources (in order of precedence):

1. Environment variables
2. .env file variables
3. Default configuration values

Key configuration options:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Flask secret key for session security | *required* |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection string | `sqlite:///app.db` |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection for caching & sessions | `redis://localhost:6379/0` |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | Secret for JWT token generation | *required* |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Application environment | `development` |
| `CLOUD_PROVIDERS_ENABLED` | Enable cloud provider integrations | `True` |
| `FILE_INTEGRITY_MONITORING` | Enable file integrity monitoring | `True` |
| `FILE_BASELINE_PATH` | Path to integrity baseline file | `instance/file_baseline.json` |

See the environment example files in the `deployment/environments/` directory for a comprehensive list of configuration options.

### Deployment

For production deployment, follow the documentation in the deployment directory:

```bash
# Set up production configuration
cp deployment/environments/production.env.example deployment/environments/production.env
# Edit production.env with your production settings

# Deploy using the deployment script
cd deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh production
```

For detailed deployment instructions including cloud provider-specific deployment, container deployment, and Kubernetes deployment, refer to README.md.

## API Reference

The platform provides a comprehensive RESTful API for integration with external systems. All APIs use JWT authentication and follow consistent patterns for requests and responses.

Key API categories:

- **Authentication**: User authentication and token management
- **Cloud Resources**: Managing cloud provider resources
- **ICS Systems**: Industrial control system monitoring and control
- **Webhooks**: Event subscription and notification
- **Security**: Security incident management and reporting

API features include:

- Consistent error handling and status codes
- Comprehensive input validation
- Proper rate limiting and throttling
- Detailed documentation with examples
- Secure authentication and authorization

For detailed API documentation, see api-overview.md.

## Security Features

The platform implements a defense-in-depth security approach with multiple layers of protection:

- Content Security Policy (CSP) with nonce-based script validation
- CSRF protection for all forms and API endpoints
- Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks for static assets
- Secure cookie handling and session management
- Password security with strength requirements and history checks
- Input validation and sanitization against XSS and injection attacks
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) with customized rule sets
- Multi-factor authentication support
