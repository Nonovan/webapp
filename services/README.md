## Overview

Services encapsulate complex operations and provide clean APIs for controllers/routes to use. They follow a functional core/imperative shell architecture where business logic is separated from side effects (like database operations). This approach enhances testability and maintainability by reducing complexity in individual components.

## Key Services

- **`AuthService`**: User authentication, registration, and session management
  - **Usage**: Use this service for user authentication, registration, and session-related operations
  - **Features**:
    - Password-based authentication with brute force protection
    - User registration with validation
    - Session management with security features
    - JWT token generation for API authentication
    - Two-factor authentication support

- **`EmailService`**: Email template rendering and delivery
  - **Usage**: Use this service to send emails using templates or raw content
  - **Features**:
    - Template-based email rendering
    - Multiple content formats (HTML and plain text)
    - File attachment support
    - Email delivery tracking
    - Batch email operations

- **`NewsletterService`**: Subscription management and newsletter distribution
  - **Usage**: Use this service to handle newsletter subscriptions and send newsletters to subscribers
  - **Features**:
    - Subscription with email verification
    - Unsubscribe functionality
    - Newsletter distribution to subscribers
    - Subscription analytics and reporting
    - Batch sending with configurable limits

- **`SecurityService`**: Security operations including file integrity monitoring
  - **Usage**: Use this service for security-related operations including file integrity verification
  - **Features**:
    - File integrity monitoring and verification
    - Security baseline management
    - File hash calculation with multiple algorithms
    - Change detection for security-critical files
    - Comprehensive security logging and metrics

## Best Practices & Security

- Always validate inputs before processing in services
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
- Implement proper transaction management with rollbacks on errors
- Store sensitive data securely using appropriate encryption
- Use rate limiting for public-facing services
- Log sensitive operations for audit purposes
- Avoid hardcoding credentials in service files
- Create unit tests for all service functions

## Common Features

- Comprehensive error handling with consistent error formats
- Database transaction management
- Secure resource access through proper authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Detailed logging with appropriate levels
- Cache integration for performance optimization
- Rate limiting for public-facing endpoints
- Defensive programming patterns

## Usage

### Authentication

```python
from services import AuthService

# User login
success, user, error_message = AuthService.authenticate_user('username', 'password')
if success:
    AuthService.login_user_session(user)
else:
    print(f"Login failed: {error_message}")

# User registration
success, user, error_message = AuthService.register_user(
    username='newuser',
    email='user@example.com',
    password='secure_password'
)
```

### Email Sending

```python
from services import send_email, send_template_email

# Send a simple email
send_email(
    to='recipient@example.com',
    subject='Important notification',
    html_content='<h1>Hello!</h1><p>This is an important message.</p>'
)

# Send a templated email
send_template_email(
    to='recipient@example.com',
    subject='Welcome to our platform',
    template_name='welcome_email',
    template_data={
        'username': 'john_doe',
        'activation_link': 'https://example.com/activate/123'
    }
)
```

### Newsletter Management

```python
from services import NewsletterService

# Subscribe a user
result = NewsletterService.subscribe_email('subscriber@example.com')

# Send a newsletter
result = NewsletterService.send_newsletter(
    subject='Monthly Update',
    content='<h1>Monthly Newsletter</h1><p>Latest updates...</p>'
)

# Get subscription statistics
stats = NewsletterService.get_stats()
```

### Security Operations

```python
from services import check_integrity, update_security_baseline

# Check file integrity
integrity_status, changes = check_integrity()
if not integrity_status:
    print(f"File integrity check failed with {len(changes)} changes detected")
    for change in changes:
        print(f"File: {change['path']}, Status: {change['status']}")

# Update security baseline for specific paths
paths_to_update = ['/path/to/critical/file.py', '/path/to/config.json']
success, message = update_security_baseline(paths_to_update)
if success:
    print(f"Baseline updated successfully: {message}")
else:
    print(f"Baseline update failed: {message}")
```
