## Best Practices & Security

- All security scripts should be owned by root:root with 750 permissions
- Always run scripts with appropriate privileges (usually root)
- Schedule regular execution via cron for continuous security monitoring
- Always review reports generated by these scripts, especially security_audit.py
- Log all script activities to `/var/log/cloud-platform/security/`
- Store sensitive credentials securely in environment variables
- Never hardcode API keys or passwords in these scripts
- Test scripts in development environments before running in production
- Keep all security tools updated to address new threats

## Common Features

- Comprehensive logging with consistent format
- Multiple output formats (text, JSON, HTML, CSV)
- Email notification capabilities
- Integration with monitoring systems
- Environment-specific configurations
- Proper error handling and exit codes
- Clean help and usage documentation
- Verbose and quiet operation modes
- Secure handling of credentials and sensitive data

## Usage

### Security Auditing

```bash
# Run a comprehensive security audit
./security_audit.py --email security@example.com --report-format html

# Check and fix permissions in the security directory
./check_permissions.sh --fix-permissions --verbose

# Verify file integrity
./verify_files.py --target-dir /etc --report-only
```

### Security Updates and Maintenance

```bash
# Apply security updates with notification
./apply_security_updates.sh --environment production --notify

# Check SSL certificate expiration
./check_certificate_expiration.sh --domain example.com --warn-days 30

# Set up SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt
./ssl-setup.sh --domain example.com --email admin@example.com
```

### Security Monitoring

```bash
# List privileged users
./list_users.sh --admins-only

# Check firewall rules
./firewall_check.sh --compare-policy

# Analyze security logs
./log_analyzer.py --detect-threats --last-hours 24

# Generate security keys
./generate_security_keys.py --type rsa --size 4096 --output /etc/ssl/private/
```

## Integration

These scripts integrate with other platform components:

- **Monitoring**: Reports can be sent to the central monitoring system
- **Alerting**: Critical findings trigger security alerts
- **Documentation**: Results can be used to update security documentation
- **CI/CD**: Some scripts can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline

## Emergency Response

In case of a security incident:

1. Run `security_audit.py --emergency` to perform an immediate full security scan
2. Review `/var/log/cloud-platform/security/incident*.log` for security events
3. Contact the security team at <security@example.com>
4. For critical incidents, call the security hotline: +1-555-123-4567

## Compliance

These scripts help maintain compliance with:

- ISO 27001
- SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- PCI DSS (where applicable)
- HIPAA (where applicable)
