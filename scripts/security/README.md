# Security Scripts

This directory contains security-related scripts for the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

## Overview

These scripts provide essential security controls, monitoring, and management capabilities for the platform. They are designed to enforce security best practices, identify vulnerabilities, and support compliance requirements across development, staging, and production environments.

## Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `security_audit.py` | Comprehensive security audit tool that checks for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and security updates |
| check_permissions.sh | Validates and optionally fixes file/directory permissions and ownership |
| apply_security_updates.sh | Safely applies security updates with rollback capabilities |
| `verify_files.py` | File integrity verification tool to detect unauthorized changes |
| `list_users.sh` | Identifies privileged users and analyzes account security |
| `firewall_check.sh` | Verifies firewall rules against security policy |
| `log_analyzer.py` | Analyzes security logs for suspicious activities |

## Usage

Most scripts support various options to customize their behavior:

```bash
# Run a comprehensive security audit
./security_audit.py --email security@example.com --report-format html

# Check and fix permissions in the security directory
./check_permissions.sh --fix-permissions --verbose

# Apply security updates with notification
./apply_security_updates.sh --environment production --notify

# Verify file integrity
./verify_files.py --target-dir /etc --report-only

# List privileged users
./list_users.sh --admins-only

# Check firewall rules
./firewall_check.sh --compare-policy

# Analyze security logs
./log_analyzer.py --detect-threats --last-hours 24

```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Permissions**: All security scripts should be owned by root:root with 750 permissions
2. **Execution**: Run these scripts with appropriate privileges (usually root)
3. **Automation**: Schedule regular execution via cron for continuous security monitoring
4. **Review**: Always review reports generated by these scripts, especially security_audit.py
5. **Logging**: All scripts log their activities to `/var/log/cloud-platform/security/`

## Security Controls

These scripts support the following security controls:

- **Vulnerability Management**: Identify and remediate security vulnerabilities
- **Configuration Management**: Ensure secure system configurations
- **Access Control**: Validate proper file permissions and user access
- **Patching**: Secure and reliable security update application
- **File Integrity**: Detect unauthorized file modifications
- **Compliance**: Generate reports for compliance requirements

## Integration

These scripts integrate with other platform components:

- **Monitoring**: Reports can be sent to the central monitoring system
- **Alerting**: Critical findings trigger security alerts
- **Documentation**: Results can be used to update security documentation
- **CI/CD**: Some scripts can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline

## Emergency Response

In case of a security incident:

1. Run `security_audit.py --emergency` to perform an immediate full security scan
2. Review `/var/log/cloud-platform/security/incident*.log` for security events
3. Contact the security team at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
4. For critical incidents, call the security hotline: +1-555-123-4567

## Maintenance

- Scripts are regularly updated to address new security threats
- Version control ensures all changes are tracked
- Testing in development environments before deployment to production
- Regular validation against security benchmarks (CIS, NIST)

## Compliance

These scripts help maintain compliance with:

- ISO 27001
- SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- PCI DSS (where applicable)
- HIPAA (where applicable)
