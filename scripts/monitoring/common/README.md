# Common Monitoring Utilities

This directory contains common utilities and shared functions used across monitoring scripts for the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

## Overview

These utilities provide standardized functionality used by multiple monitoring components, ensuring consistency in logging, error handling, and configuration management. They form the foundation for all monitoring capabilities of the platform, reducing code duplication and enforcing best practices.

## Key Scripts

- **`config_loader.sh`** - Loads environment-specific configuration files
- **`credentials_manager.sh`** - Secure handling of authentication credentials
- **`date_utils.sh`** - Date and time manipulation functions
- **`error_handling.sh`** - Standardized error handling and reporting
- **`format_utils.sh`** - Output formatting for reports and notifications
- **`logging_utils.sh`** - Standard logging functions with consistent formatting
- **`network_utils.sh`** - Common network connectivity and testing functions
- **`validation.sh`** - Input validation and sanitization

## Directory Structure

```

/scripts/monitoring/common/
├── config_loader.sh       # Configuration management functions
├── credentials_manager.sh # Secure credential handling
├── date_utils.sh          # Date manipulation utilities
├── error_handling.sh      # Error tracking and reporting
├── format_utils.sh        # Report and notification formatting

├── network_utils.sh       # Network testing and connectivity
├── [README.md](http://readme.md/)              # This documentation file
└── [validation.sh](http://validation.sh/)          # Input validation functions

```

## Usage

These utilities are designed to be sourced by other scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Source common utilities
source "$(dirname "$0")/../common/logging_utils.sh"
source "$(dirname "$0")/../common/config_loader.sh"

# Use the utilities
log_info "Starting monitoring process"
load_config "$ENVIRONMENT"

```

## Key Features

- **Standardized Logging** - Consistent log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- **Environment-aware Configuration** - Load settings based on deployment environment
- **Secure Credential Handling** - Protect sensitive authentication information
- **Error Handling Framework** - Track, report, and respond to errors systematically
- **Output Formatting** - Generate reports and notifications in multiple formats (text, JSON, CSV, HTML)
- **Input Validation** - Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - Prevent cascading failures through automatic service protection
- **Date & Time Utilities** - Consistent handling of timestamps across time zones
- **Network Diagnostics** - Standardized connectivity tests and endpoint health checks

## Common Features

Each utility script in this directory follows these conventions:

- **Version Tracking** - Each script includes a version identifier
- **Standalone Testing** - Scripts can be executed directly for self-testing
- **Comprehensive Error Handling** - All operations validate inputs and handle edge cases
- **Consistent Function Naming** - Functions follow the `[module]_[action]` naming pattern
- **Exported Functions** - All public functions are properly exported for sourcing
- **Documentation** - All functions include detailed usage documentation

## Best Practices

- Always use these common utilities rather than implementing similar functionality
- Follow the error handling patterns to ensure proper exit codes
- Use the validation functions to sanitize inputs
- Log appropriately using the provided severity levels
- Import only the utilities you need, with logging_utils.sh typically being the minimum
- Always handle potential failures in called functions

## Security Considerations

- Credential information is never logged or displayed in reports
- All user inputs are validated before use
- Authentication tokens are stored securely in memory
- File permissions are automatically set appropriately for sensitive files
- Error reports exclude sensitive details from stack traces
- Network requests include appropriate timeouts and circuit breaker protection

## Extending the Utilities

When adding new functionality:

1. Determine if it belongs in an existing utility or warrants a new file
2. Follow the established coding patterns and documentation style
3. Add appropriate error handling and input validation
4. Include self-testing functionality when run directly
5. Update this [README.md](http://readme.md/) with new capabilities
6. Add unit tests in the `../tests` directory
