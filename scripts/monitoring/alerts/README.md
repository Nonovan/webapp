# Monitoring Alerts

This directory contains scripts for configuring, managing, and processing alerts for the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

## Overview

The alerts system enables real-time monitoring and notification when specific conditions occur across the infrastructure. These scripts handle alert generation, delivery, and management.

## Scripts

- `alert_on_events.sh` - Monitors event logs and triggers alerts based on configured patterns
- `configure_alerts.sh` - Sets up alert thresholds and notification channels
- `alert_manager.sh` - Manages alert lifecycle (creation, acknowledgment, resolution)
- `notification_dispatcher.sh` - Handles delivery of alerts through various channels (email, SMS, webhook)
- `alert_templates.sh` - Manages templates for formatted alert messages

## Alert Channels

- Email notifications
- PagerDuty integration
- Slack notifications
- SMS for critical alerts
- Webhook integration for third-party systems

## Alert Severity Levels

1. **Critical**: Immediate action required (service down, data loss risk)
2. **Warning**: Action required soon (approaching resource limits, degraded performance)
3. **Info**: No immediate action required (noteworthy events, potential issues)

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Configure alerts for production environment
./configure_alerts.sh production

# Test alert delivery to all channels
./notification_dispatcher.sh --test-all

# Set custom thresholds for CPU alerts
./configure_alerts.sh production --metric cpu_usage --warning 80 --critical 95

# Enable alerts for a specific service
./alert_manager.sh --enable database
```

## Security Considerations

- Alert configurations are validated to prevent tampering
- Authentication is required for modifying alert settings
- Alert delivery channels use encrypted communication
