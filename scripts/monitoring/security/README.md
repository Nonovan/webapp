# Security Monitoring and Analysis

This directory contains security monitoring and analysis scripts for the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

## Overview

These scripts provide comprehensive security monitoring, analysis, and reporting capabilities to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats and vulnerabilities across the platform.

## Key Scripts

- `security_scanner.sh` - Performs security scanning of infrastructure and applications
- `intrusion_detection.sh` - Monitors for suspicious activity and potential intrusions
- `vulnerability_tracker.sh` - Tracks and reports on known vulnerabilities
- `compliance_checker.sh` - Verifies compliance with security policies and standards
- `access_analyzer.sh` - Analyzes access patterns and detects anomalies
- `certificate_monitor.sh` - Monitors SSL/TLS certificate status and expiration
- `file_integrity.sh` - Monitors critical files for unauthorized changes
- `security_dashboard.sh` - Generates security status dashboards

## Capabilities

### Security Scanning

- Network port scanning
- Web application vulnerability scanning
- Configuration validation
- Dependency security checking
- Container image scanning

### Intrusion Detection

- Log pattern analysis
- Behavior anomaly detection
- Network traffic analysis
- Authentication attempt monitoring
- Privilege escalation detection

### Compliance Checking

- Policy enforcement verification
- Regulatory compliance checks
- Security baseline validation
- Best practice adherence
- Audit trail verification

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Run comprehensive security scan
./security_scanner.sh --comprehensive

# Monitor for intrusion attempts
./intrusion_detection.sh --watch --alert-on-suspicious

# Check certificate expiration
./certificate_monitor.sh --domain example.com --warn-days 30

# Verify file integrity
./file_integrity.sh --critical-files --alert-on-change
```

## Integration

- Integrates with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems
- Feeds data to security dashboards
- Connects with ticketing systems for vulnerability tracking
- Sends alerts to security response teams

## Security Best Practices

- Never expose security vulnerabilities publicly
- Encrypt sensitive security findings
- Limit access to security monitoring tools
- Regularly update security baselines
- Follow the principle of least privilege
