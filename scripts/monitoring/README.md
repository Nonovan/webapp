# Monitoring Scripts

This directory contains scripts and utilities for monitoring the Cloud Infrastructure Platform across different environments. The scripts handle various aspects of system monitoring, performance tracking, and alerting.

## Overview

The monitoring scripts provide comprehensive system health verification, performance analysis, alerting, and reporting capabilities for the Cloud Infrastructure Platform. These scripts are designed to work across all deployment environments (development, staging, production) with environment-specific configurations and thresholds.

## Key Scripts

- **`alerts/alert_manager.sh`**: Manages the alert lifecycle
  - **Usage**: Run this script to create, acknowledge, or resolve alerts.
  - **Features**:
    - Alert creation and tracking
    - Notification dispatch
    - Status management
    - Batch processing capabilities

- **`core/health-check.sh`**: Comprehensive system health verification script
  - **Usage**: Run this script to verify overall system health status.
  - **Features**:
    - Component-level health checks
    - Environment-specific validation
    - Multiple output formats (text, JSON)
    - Integration with notification systems

- **`core/status_reporter.sh`**: Generates comprehensive status reports
  - **Usage**: Run this script to generate status reports for various environments.
  - **Features**:
    - Aggregates data from multiple monitoring sources
    - Configurable report formats
    - Historical trend tracking
    - Automated email distribution

- **`performance/load_test.sh`**: Performs API and web application load testing
  - **Usage**: Run this script to conduct performance tests.
  - **Features**:
    - Concurrent request simulation
    - Response time analysis
    - Threshold-based pass/fail determination
    - Detailed performance metrics collection

## Best Practices & Security

- Always specify environment when running scripts
- Use the `--help` flag to see available options for each script
- Review logs regularly for monitoring system health
- Set appropriate permissions on configuration files
- Test monitoring changes in staging before deploying to production
- Scripts utilize secure credential handling via environment variables
- API keys and sensitive parameters are never hardcoded
- All monitoring activities are logged for audit purposes
- Access to certain monitoring capabilities requires appropriate authentication

## Common Features

- Environment-aware configuration
- Standardized logging formats
- Integration with central monitoring systems
- Alert generation via multiple channels (email, SMS, webhook)
- Historical data collection and trend analysis
- Circuit breaker patterns for failure handling
- Secure credential management
- Comprehensive error reporting

## Usage

Most monitoring scripts support environment parameters and follow a consistent pattern:

```bash
./script_name.sh [environment] [options]
```

For example:
```bash
./core/health-check.sh production --region primary --format json
./alerts/alert_manager.sh staging --create --type warning --message "Disk space warning"
./performance/load_test.sh development --concurrency 10 --duration 60
./core/metric_collector.sh production --store-history --notify
```
