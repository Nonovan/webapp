# Monitoring Scripts

This directory contains scripts and utilities for monitoring the Cloud Infrastructure Platform across different environments. The scripts handle various aspects of system monitoring, performance tracking, and alerting.

## Directory Structure

- [alerts/](./alerts/) - Scripts for configuring, managing, and processing alerts
- [common/](./common/) - Common utilities and shared functions used across monitoring scripts
- [config/](./config/) - Configuration files for monitoring tools and services
- [core/](./core/) - Core monitoring functionality and reusable components
- [logs/](./logs/) - Log processing, analysis, and management scripts
- [metrics/](./metrics/) - Scripts for collecting, processing, and exporting metrics
- [performance/](./performance/) - System and application performance analysis tools
- [security/](./security/) - Security monitoring and analysis scripts
- [templates/](./templates/) - Template files for reports, dashboards, and notifications
- [tests/](./tests/) - Test scripts for monitoring functionality

## Usage

Most monitoring scripts support environment parameters and follow a consistent pattern:

```bash
./script_name.sh [environment] [options]
```

For example:
```bash
./performance/system_analysis.sh production --detailed
./alerts/alert_on_events.sh staging --threshold 90
```

## Common Features

- Environment-aware configuration
- Standardized logging formats
- Integration with central monitoring systems
- Alert generation via multiple channels (email, SMS, webhook)
- Historical data collection and trend analysis

## Security Considerations

- Scripts utilize secure credential handling via environment variables
- API keys and sensitive parameters are never hardcoded
- All monitoring activities are logged for audit purposes
- Access to certain monitoring capabilities requires appropriate authentication
