# Performance Analysis Tools

This directory contains system and application performance analysis tools for the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

## Overview

These tools provide capabilities to measure, analyze, and optimize the performance of various components of the platform, helping to identify bottlenecks, validate performance requirements, and guide optimization efforts.

## Key Scripts

- `system_analysis.sh` - Analyzes system-level performance metrics
- `application_profiler.sh` - Profiles application performance using tracing
- `load_test.sh` - Performs load testing against API endpoints
- `stress_test.sh` - Conducts stress testing to find system limits
- `resource_profiler.sh` - Detailed profiling of resource usage
- `database_performance.sh` - Analyzes database performance and query efficiency
- `network_analyzer.sh` - Analyzes network performance and latency
- `response_time_analyzer.sh` - Breaks down request/response time components

## Features

### System Performance Analysis

- CPU performance and bottleneck detection
- Memory usage patterns and leak detection
- I/O performance analysis
- System call profiling
- Resource contention identification

### Application Performance Analysis

- Request latency breakdown
- API endpoint performance comparison
- Transaction time analysis
- Hotspot identification in code execution
- Cache effectiveness evaluation

### Load and Stress Testing

- Simulated user load testing
- Concurrent request handling capability
- Resource scaling under load
- Breaking point identification
- Recovery time measurement

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Run detailed system performance analysis
./system_analysis.sh production --detailed

# Profile application performance
./application_profiler.sh --service api-gateway --duration 30m

# Perform load testing with gradually increasing user count
./load_test.sh --endpoint /api/v1/resources --users 10-100 --step 10 --duration 5m

# Analyze database query performance
./database_performance.sh --slow-queries --explain
```

## Integration

- Exports results to Grafana dashboards
- Stores historical performance data for trend analysis
- Integrates with CI/CD pipelines for performance regression testing

## Best Practices

- Run baseline performance tests before and after significant changes
- Compare performance across environments (dev, staging, production)
- Focus on user-impacting metrics (response time, throughput)
- Document performance optimization efforts and results
