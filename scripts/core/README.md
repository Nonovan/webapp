## Best Practices

- **Reusability**: Use `common_functions.sh` for shared functionality to avoid code duplication.
- **Security**: Ensure scripts are executed with the least privilege required.
- **Logging**: Review logs generated by these scripts regularly for anomalies.
- **Testing**: Test scripts in a staging environment before deploying to production.
- **Validation**: Use `config_validator.sh` to validate configuration files before applying changes.
