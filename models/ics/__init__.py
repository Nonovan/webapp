"""
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) models package for the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

This package contains database models related to industrial control systems including:
- ICSDevice: For managing and monitoring industrial control system devices
- ICSReading: For tracking sensor readings and telemetry data from ICS devices
- ICSControlLog: For auditing control operations performed on ICS devices

These models provide the foundation for secure management and monitoring of
industrial control systems, enabling operational technology (OT) integration
with IT systems while maintaining proper security controls and audit trails.
