# Alert Models

## Overview

This directory contains database models for the Cloud Infrastructure Platform's alert management system. These models provide a centralized foundation for tracking, managing, and correlating system alerts across the platform, with support for prioritization, notification, escalation, and resolution workflows.

The alert models enable real-time monitoring and response to critical events while ensuring proper notification routing, alert correlation, and lifecycle management.

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Alert

```python
from models.alerts import Alert

# Create a new alert
alert = Alert(
    alert_type='high_cpu',
    service_name='web',
    severity=Alert.SEVERITY_WARNING,
    message='CPU usage exceeded 90%',
    environment='production',
    details={
        'current_value': 92.5,
        'threshold': 90.0,
        'duration': '5 minutes',
        'host': 'web-server-01'
    },
    resource_id='web-server-01',
    region='us-west-2'
)
alert.save()  # Automatically saves to database
```

### Acknowledging an Alert

```python
# Find and acknowledge an alert
alert = Alert.query.get(1234)
if alert:
    alert.acknowledge(
        user="john.doe",
        note="Investigating the high CPU usage"
    )
```

### Resolving an Alert

```python
# Resolve an alert
alert = Alert.query.get(1234)
if alert:
    alert.resolve(
        user="john.doe",
        resolution_note="Added additional capacity to handle the load",
        resolution_type=Alert.RESOLUTION_FIXED
    )
```

### Finding Active Alerts

```python
# Get active alerts with priority sorting
critical_alerts = Alert.get_active_alerts(
    environment='production',
    severity=[Alert.SEVERITY_CRITICAL, Alert.SEVERITY_HIGH],
    limit=50
)
```

### Working with Alert Correlation

```python
from models.alerts import AlertCorrelation

# Find alerts correlated to a specific alert
correlation_engine = AlertCorrelation()
correlated_alerts = correlation_engine.find_correlated_alerts(alert_id=1234)

# Group similar alerts
alert_groups = Alert.get_alert_groups(
    environment='production',
    max_alerts=100
)

# Update correlation information for an alert
AlertCorrelation.update_alert_with_correlations(alert_id=1234)
```

### Getting Alert Statistics

```python
# Get alert statistics for the past 7 days
stats = Alert.get_alert_counts(
    environment='production',
    days=7
)

print(f"Total alerts: {stats['total']}")
print(f"Critical alerts: {stats['by_severity']['critical']}")
print(f"Active alerts: {stats['by_status']['active']}")
```

### Searching and Filtering Alerts

```python
# Search for alerts with various filters
search_results = Alert.search_alerts(
    severity='critical',
    status='active',
    environment='production',
    service_name='database',
    start_date=yesterday,
    end_date=now,
    page=1,
    per_page=20
)
```

### Checking SLA Compliance

```python
# Check if an alert is meeting its SLA
alert = Alert.query.get(1234)
sla_info = alert.check_alert_sla()

if sla_info['sla_met']:
    print(f"Alert is meeting its SLA (deadline: {sla_info['deadline']})")
else:
    print(f"Alert has missed its SLA! Overdue by {abs(sla_info['time_remaining_seconds'])/3600} hours")
```

### Creating an Alert from Event Data

```python
# Create an alert from external event data
event_data = {
    'alert_type': 'service_down',
    'service_name': 'api',
    'severity': 'critical',
    'message': 'API service is not responding',
    'environment': 'production',
    'details': {
        'endpoint': '/v1/users',
        'status_code': 503,
        'duration_seconds': 180
    }
}

new_alert = Alert.create_from_event(event_data)
if new_alert:
    print(f"Created alert ID: {new_alert.id}")
```

### Auto-acknowledging Stale Alerts

```python
# Auto-acknowledge alerts that have been open too long
acknowledged_count = Alert.auto_acknowledge_stale_alerts()
print(f"Auto-acknowledged {acknowledged_count} stale alerts")
```

### Managing Alert Notifications

```python
from models.alerts import AlertNotification

# Create a notification for an alert
notification = AlertNotification.create_notification(
    alert=alert,
    channel='email',
    recipient='ops-team@example.com',
    template='critical_alert',
    extra_context={'escalation_level': 'urgent'}
)

# Get pending notifications for processing
pending = AlertNotification.get_pending_notifications(limit=50)
for notification in pending:
    # Process and send the notification
    success = send_notification(notification)
    if success:
        notification.mark_delivered()
    else:
        notification.mark_failed("Delivery failed: recipient not found")
```

### Setting Up Alert Suppression

```python
from models.alerts import AlertSuppression

# Create a maintenance suppression window
suppression = AlertSuppression.create_maintenance_suppression(
    service_name='database',
    environment='production',
    duration_hours=4,
    created_by='jane.smith',
    description='Database maintenance window'
)

# Create a throttling rule to limit alert volume
throttle_rule = AlertSuppression.create_throttle_rule(
    name='High CPU Throttle',
    criteria={'alert_type': 'high_cpu', 'service_name': 'web'},
    environment='production',
    created_by='admin',
    max_alerts=3,
    time_period_minutes=15,
    description='Limit high CPU alerts to prevent storms'
)

# Check if an alert should be suppressed
suppression_info = AlertSuppression.should_alert_be_suppressed(alert)
if suppression_info.get('suppressed'):
    print(f"Alert suppressed by rule: {suppression_info['rule_name']}")
```

### Working with Alert Metrics

```python
from models.alerts import AlertMetrics

# Calculate daily metrics for yesterday
yesterday = datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(days=1)
metrics = AlertMetrics.calculate_daily_metrics(
    target_date=yesterday,
    environment='production'
)

# Get trend data for the last 30 days
trends = AlertMetrics.get_trend_data(
    days=30,
    environment='production'
)

# Calculate any missing daily metrics
calculated_count = AlertMetrics.calculate_missing_daily_metrics(days_back=7)
print(f"Calculated metrics for {calculated_count} missing days")
```

### Escalating an Alert

```python
from models.alerts import AlertEscalation

# Escalate an alert due to timeout
escalation = AlertEscalation.create(
    alert=alert,
    new_severity='critical',
    reason=AlertEscalation.REASON_TIME,
    escalated_by='system'
)

# Check for alerts that need time-based escalation
escalated_count = AlertEscalation.check_for_escalations()
print(f"Automatically escalated {escalated_count} alerts")
```

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: All alert data undergoes thorough validation to prevent injection
- **Message Sanitization**: Alert messages are sanitized to prevent XSS
- **Audit Logging**: All status changes are logged for security audit trail
- **Access Controls**: Alert operations require appropriate permissions
- **Metadata Security**: Alert details storage validates against DoS (deep nesting, size limits)
- **Environment Separation**: Strict environment separation prevents cross-environment issues
- **User Attribution**: All operations track the responsible user
- **Alert Throttling**: Prevention of alert floods that could impact system performance
- **Secure Defaults**: Conservative defaults for auto-escalation and acknowledgment
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary information is stored in alerts

## Best Practices

- **Alert Classification**: Use consistent alert types and severities
- **Descriptive Messages**: Write clear, actionable alert messages
- **Proper Metadata**: Include relevant context in the details field
- **Service Association**: Always link alerts to the affected service
- **Resource Linking**: Link to specific resources when available
- **Environment Tagging**: Always specify the environment for proper routing
- **Alert Resolution**: Add meaningful resolution notes to build knowledge base
- **Alert Correlation**: Use correlation features to reduce alert noise
- **SLA Adherence**: Respect SLA response times based on severity
- **Regular Cleanup**: Use auto-acknowledge features for stale alerts
- **Alert Analysis**: Regularly review alert trends to improve monitoring
