# Alert Models

## Overview

This directory contains database models for the Cloud Infrastructure Platform's alert management system. These models provide a centralized foundation for tracking, managing, and correlating system alerts across the platform, with support for prioritization, notification, escalation, and resolution workflows.

The alert models enable real-time monitoring and response to critical events while ensuring proper notification routing, alert correlation, and lifecycle management.

## Implementation Notes

All alert models inherit from the `BaseModel` class, providing:

- Common CRUD operations (save, update, delete)
- Timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at)
- Type annotations for better IDE support
- Common query methods and validation

Alert models are designed with these principles:

- **Comprehensive tracking**: Complete lifecycle management from creation to resolution
- **Flexible storage**: Structured metadata storage with variable content
- **Correlation support**: Advanced algorithms to identify related alerts
- **Integration capabilities**: Hooks for notification and reporting services
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient query patterns for high-volume alert processing
- **Status workflows**: Comprehensive state management for alerts
- **Audit capabilities**: Changes tracked for compliance requirements
- **Auto-escalation**: Time-based severity escalation for critical alerts
- **SLA management**: Deadline tracking for response times based on severity

## Features

- **Alert Lifecycle Management**: Complete tracking from creation to resolution
- **Severity Classification**: Multi-level severity ratings (critical, high, warning, info)
- **Status Tracking**: Alert state management (active, acknowledged, resolved)
- **Alert Correlation**: Identification of related alerts to prevent alert storms
- **Environment Awareness**: Support for different deployment environments
- **Service Organization**: Grouping alerts by affected services
- **Resource Tracking**: Association with affected cloud resources
- **Notification Integration**: Hooks for multi-channel notification delivery
- **Auto-acknowledgement**: Time-based auto-acknowledgement for stale alerts
- **SLA Compliance**: Response time tracking based on severity
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple alerts
- **Advanced Filtering**: Comprehensive query capabilities
- **Statistics Generation**: Metrics and analytics on alert volumes and trends
- **Metadata Support**: Flexible storage of alert-specific details
- **Regional Awareness**: Geographic organization of alerts

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Alert

```python
from models.alerts import Alert

# Create a new alert
alert = Alert(
    alert_type='high_cpu',
    service_name='web',
    severity=Alert.SEVERITY_WARNING,
    message='CPU usage exceeded 90%',
    environment='production',
    details={
        'current_value': 92.5,
        'threshold': 90.0,
        'duration': '5 minutes',
        'host': 'web-server-01'
    },
    resource_id='web-server-01',
    region='us-west-2'
)
alert.save()  # Automatically saves to database
```

### Acknowledging an Alert

```python
# Find and acknowledge an alert
alert = Alert.query.get(1234)
if alert:
    alert.acknowledge(
        user="john.doe",
        note="Investigating the high CPU usage"
    )
```

### Resolving an Alert

```python
# Resolve an alert
alert = Alert.query.get(1234)
if alert:
    alert.resolve(
        user="john.doe",
        resolution_note="Added additional capacity to handle the load",
        resolution_type=Alert.RESOLUTION_FIXED
    )
```

### Finding Active Alerts

```python
# Get active alerts with priority sorting
critical_alerts = Alert.get_active_alerts(
    environment='production',
    severity=[Alert.SEVERITY_CRITICAL, Alert.SEVERITY_HIGH],
    limit=50
)
```

### Working with Alert Correlation

```python
from models.alerts import AlertCorrelation

# Find alerts correlated to a specific alert
correlation_engine = AlertCorrelation()
correlated_alerts = correlation_engine.find_correlated_alerts(alert_id=1234)

# Group similar alerts
alert_groups = Alert.get_alert_groups(
    environment='production',
    max_alerts=100
)

# Update correlation information for an alert
AlertCorrelation.update_alert_with_correlations(alert_id=1234)
```

### Getting Alert Statistics

```python
# Get alert statistics for the past 7 days
stats = Alert.get_alert_counts(
    environment='production',
    days=7
)

print(f"Total alerts: {stats['total']}")
print(f"Critical alerts: {stats['by_severity']['critical']}")
print(f"Active alerts: {stats['by_status']['active']}")
```

### Searching and Filtering Alerts

```python
# Search for alerts with various filters
search_results = Alert.search_alerts(
    severity='critical',
    status='active',
    environment='production',
    service_name='database',
    start_date=yesterday,
    end_date=now,
    page=1,
    per_page=20
)
```

### Checking SLA Compliance

```python
# Check if an alert is meeting its SLA
alert = Alert.query.get(1234)
sla_info = alert.check_alert_sla()

if sla_info['sla_met']:
    print(f"Alert is meeting its SLA (deadline: {sla_info['deadline']})")
else:
    print(f"Alert has missed its SLA! Overdue by {abs(sla_info['time_remaining_seconds'])/3600} hours")
```

### Creating an Alert from Event Data

```python
# Create an alert from external event data
event_data = {
    'alert_type': 'service_down',
    'service_name': 'api',
    'severity': 'critical',
    'message': 'API service is not responding',
    'environment': 'production',
    'details': {
        'endpoint': '/v1/users',
        'status_code': 503,
        'duration_seconds': 180
    }
}

new_alert = Alert.create_from_event(event_data)
if new_alert:
    print(f"Created alert ID: {new_alert.id}")
```

### Auto-acknowledging Stale Alerts

```python
# Auto-acknowledge alerts that have been open too long
acknowledged_count = Alert.auto_acknowledge_stale_alerts()
print(f"Auto-acknowledged {acknowledged_count} stale alerts")
```

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: All alert data undergoes thorough validation to prevent injection
- **Message Sanitization**: Alert messages are sanitized to prevent XSS
- **Audit Logging**: All status changes are logged for security audit trail
- **Access Controls**: Alert operations require appropriate permissions
- **Metadata Security**: Alert details storage validates against DoS (deep nesting, size limits)
- **Environment Separation**: Strict environment separation prevents cross-environment issues
- **User Attribution**: All operations track the responsible user
- **Alert Throttling**: Prevention of alert floods that could impact system performance
- **Secure Defaults**: Conservative defaults for auto-escalation and acknowledgment
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary information is stored in alerts

## Best Practices

- **Alert Classification**: Use consistent alert types and severities
- **Descriptive Messages**: Write clear, actionable alert messages
- **Proper Metadata**: Include relevant context in the details field
- **Service Association**: Always link alerts to the affected service
- **Resource Linking**: Link to specific resources when available
- **Environment Tagging**: Always specify the environment for proper routing
- **Alert Resolution**: Add meaningful resolution notes to build knowledge base
- **Alert Correlation**: Use correlation features to reduce alert noise
- **SLA Adherence**: Respect SLA response times based on severity
- **Regular Cleanup**: Use auto-acknowledge features for stale alerts
- **Alert Analysis**: Regularly review alert trends to improve monitoring
