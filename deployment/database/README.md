## Overview

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform uses PostgreSQL as its primary database. These files help with database setup, maintenance, migration, and optimization across different environments (development, staging, and production). The management system implements proper security controls, schema versioning, automated backups, and performance monitoring.

├── schema.sql             # Reference schema definition for the entire database
└── seed.sql               # Initial data seeding script
```

## Environment Configuration

The database connection details for each environment are configured in:

1. Environment files (`.env`) in the environments directory
2. `db_config.ini` for initialization and maintenance scripts
3. Flask application configuration files

Configuration parameters include:

- Connection credentials
- Connection pool settings
- SSL configuration
- Timeout values
- Performance parameters

## Quick Start

### Initialize a New Database

```bash
# For development environment
python deployment/database/init_db.py --env development

# For staging environment
python deployment/database/init_db.py --env staging

# For production environment
python deployment/database/init_db.py --env production --schema-only
```

### Apply Migrations

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

### Create a New Migration

```bash
flask db migrate -m "Description of changes"
```

### Database Maintenance Tasks

Regular maintenance tasks are documented in the maintenance guide and include:

#### Daily Tasks

- Backup verification
- Database statistics updates
- Log review

#### Weekly Tasks

- Database vacuuming
- Index maintenance
- Review of long-running queries

#### Monthly Tasks

- Full database optimization
- User access review
- Storage capacity planning

## Migrations

Database schema changes are managed through migrations using Flask-Migrate (Alembic). The migration system provides:

- Version-controlled schema changes
- Safe application of changes across environments
- Ability to roll back changes if necessary
- Consistent schema evolution history

Key migration practices include:

1. Always review automatically generated migrations
2. Test thoroughly before applying to production
3. Ensure changes are idempotent when possible
4. Include proper downgrade methods for rollbacks
5. Separate schema changes from data migrations when possible

For detailed guidelines, see the migration guide.

## Backup and Recovery

The platform implements a comprehensive backup strategy with:

### Backup Schedule

| Environment | Full Backup | Incremental Backup | Retention Period |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Production  | Daily (3:00 AM) | Hourly | 30 days |
| Staging     | Daily (3:00 AM) | None | 14 days |
| Development | Weekly (Sunday 3:00 AM) | None | 7 days |

### Key Backup Features

- Automated backup procedures using PostgreSQL `pg_dump`
- Multi-location storage with encryption
- Regular verification through automated restore tests
- Comprehensive recovery procedures with defined RTO/RPO
- Quarterly disaster recovery testing

For detailed information, refer to the backup strategy document.

## Security Considerations

- Never commit real database credentials to version control
- Store production credentials in environment variables or a secure vault
- Use least-privilege database users for application connections
- Enable SSL for all database connections in production
- Implement IP-based access restrictions
- Monitor and audit database access
- Apply security patches promptly
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use proper schema separation for security boundaries
- Implement row-level security where appropriate

## Performance Optimization

Performance optimization strategies include:

### Query Performance

- Proper index creation and maintenance
- Query optimization using EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- Connection pooling with PgBouncer

### Configuration Optimization

- Memory settings tuned to available system resources
- Write settings optimized for workload
- Query planning parameters tuned for storage type

### Scaling Strategies

- Vertical scaling with resource increases
- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Connection pooling for connection scaling
- Sharding for very large datasets

For detailed recommendations, refer to the maintenance guide.
