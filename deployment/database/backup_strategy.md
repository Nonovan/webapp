# Database Backup and Recovery Strategy

This document outlines the backup and recovery strategies for the Cloud Infrastructure Platform databases.

## Backup Schedule

| Environment | Full Backup | Incremental Backup | Retention Period |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Production  | Daily (3:00 AM) | Hourly | 30 days |
| Staging     | Daily (3:00 AM) | None | 14 days |
| Development | Weekly (Sunday 3:00 AM) | None | 7 days |

## Backup Methods

### Automated Backups

Automated backups are performed using the following tools:

1. **PostgreSQL pg_dump**: Creates logical backups of the database
2. **CLI Tools**: Managed via the Flask CLI command: `flask db backup`
3. **Cron Jobs**: Scheduled via the crontab files in `scripts/crontabs/`

### Backup Locations

Backups are stored in the following locations:

1. **Primary Storage**: `/var/backups/cloud-platform/`
2. **Secondary Storage**: Encrypted S3 bucket `cloud-platform-backups-{environment}`
3. **Long-term Archive**: For production, monthly backups are archived to `cloud-platform-archive`

## Backup Encryption

All backups are encrypted using:

1. **In-transit**: TLS 1.3
2. **At-rest**: AES-256 encryption
3. **Key Management**: AWS KMS for cloud storage, GPG for local storage

## Backup Verification

Backup verification is performed automatically after each backup:

1. **Checksums**: SHA-256 hash verification
2. **Restore Testing**: Weekly automated restore tests to verification environment
3. **Monitoring**: Alerts are triggered if backup jobs fail or verification fails

## Recovery Procedures

### Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)

| Environment | RTO |
|-------------|-----|
| Production  | 1 hour |
| Staging     | 4 hours |
| Development | 8 hours |

### Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

| Environment | RPO |
|-------------|-----|
| Production  | 1 hour |
| Staging     | 24 hours |
| Development | 1 week |

### Recovery Process

1. **Assessment**: Determine the extent and cause of data loss
2. **Backup Selection**: Select the appropriate backup to restore from
3. **Environment Preparation**: Ensure target environment is ready
4. **Restore Operation**: Execute restore using `flask db restore <backup_file>`
5. **Verification**: Validate data integrity and application functionality
6. **Post-Recovery**: Document incident and update procedures if necessary

## Disaster Recovery Testing

Disaster recovery testing is performed quarterly, including:

1. **Full Restore**: Complete database restore to isolated environment
2. **Application Validation**: Verify application functionality with restored data
3. **Performance Testing**: Ensure restored database meets performance requirements

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**: Only authorized personnel have access to backup files
2. **Audit Logging**: All backup and restore operations are logged
3. **Secure Deletion**: Expired backups are securely deleted

## Implementation Details

See the CLI commands in `cli/commands/db.py` for implementation details of backup and restore operations.
