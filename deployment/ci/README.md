# Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

This directory contains the configuration files, scripts, and documentation for the Cloud Infrastructure Platform's continuous integration and deployment pipeline.

## Overview

The CI/CD system automates building, testing, security scanning, and deploying the Cloud Infrastructure Platform. It supports multiple CI/CD providers with equivalent functionality through configuration files tailored to each provider.

## Directory Contents

### Core Configuration Files

- [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml) - GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [`github-actions.yml`](github-actions.yml) - GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- [`Jenkinsfile`](Jenkinsfile) - Jenkins pipeline configuration
- [`sonarqube.properties`](sonarqube.properties) - SonarQube static analysis configuration

### Supporting Files

- [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) - Container for CI/CD operations
- [`entrypoint.sh`](entrypoint.sh) - Container entrypoint script
- [`config.yml`](config.yml) - Shared CI/CD configuration settings

### Scripts

The `scripts` directory contains Python scripts used during the CI/CD process:

- [`scripts/build_package.py`](scripts/build_package.py) - Builds deployment packages
- [`scripts/dependency_check.py`](scripts/dependency_check.py) - Analyzes dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- [`scripts/sast_scan.py`](scripts/sast_scan.py) - Performs static application security testing

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Prepare** - Set up the environment and install dependencies
2. **Test** - Run unit and integration tests
3. **Security** - Perform security scans and dependency checks
4. **Build** - Create deployment package and Docker images
5. **Deploy** - Deploy application to target environments
6. **Verify** - Run post-deployment checks and tests

## Environments

The pipeline supports multiple deployment environments:

- **Development** - For ongoing development work
- **Staging** - For pre-release testing
- **Production** - For live deployment

## Security Features

The pipeline includes several security measures:

- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Container security scanning
- Compliance checks
- Security test automation

## Usage

### Running Locally

You can use the Docker container to run CI/CD tasks locally:

```bash
# Build the CI container
docker build -f deployment/ci/Dockerfile -t cloud-platform-ci .

# Run a specific CI task
docker run --rm cloud-platform-ci test:unit

```

### Available Commands

The CI container supports these commands:

- `test` - Run all tests
- `test:unit` - Run unit tests
- `test:integration` - Run integration tests
- `test:e2e` - Run end-to-end tests
- `security` - Run security scans
- `build` - Build deployment package
- `deploy:staging` - Deploy to staging environment
- `deploy:production` - Deploy to production environment

## Integration with Deployment Scripts

The CI/CD pipeline leverages the scripts in the `deployment/scripts` directory for many operations:

- Pre-deployment checks
- Deployment execution
- Post-deployment verification
- Health checks
- Performance testing
- Security auditing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Failed Tests**: Check test logs for details. Most test failures include information about the specific test and assertion that failed.
- **Security Scan Failures**: Review security reports in the artifacts. Each finding includes a severity level and recommended remediation.
- **Build Failures**: Verify dependencies are available and that the build environment has sufficient resources.
- **Deployment Failures**: Check deployment logs for error messages. Common issues include connectivity problems and permission errors.

### Logs and Artifacts

CI/CD runs produce several artifacts that can help with troubleshooting:

- Test results (JUnit XML format)
- Coverage reports
- Security scan reports
- Build packages
- Deployment logs
