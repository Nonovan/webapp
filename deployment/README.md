# Deployment Documentation

This directory contains all configuration, scripts, and documentation related to deploying, maintaining, and securing the Cloud Infrastructure Platform across various environments.

## Overview

The deployment system provides a comprehensive approach to managing the platform through its entire lifecycle, from initial infrastructure provisioning to ongoing maintenance and security. Our deployment architecture supports multiple cloud providers, containerized deployments, and various environment configurations.

## Directory Structure

- [`ci/`](ci/) - CI/CD pipeline configurations and scripts
- [`cli/`](cli/) - Deployment command-line interface tools
- [`database/`](database/) - Database initialization, migration, and maintenance
- [`disaster-recovery.md`](disaster-recovery.md) - Disaster recovery procedures
- [`environments/`](environments/) - Environment-specific configuration files
- [`monitoring/`](monitoring/) - Monitoring configuration and dashboards
- [`scaling.md`](scaling.md) - Scaling strategies and implementation
- [`scripts/`](scripts/) - Deployment automation scripts
- [`security/`](security/) - Security controls, configurations, and documentation

## Quick Start

### New Environment Setup

```bash
# Set up a new environment with default configuration
cd deployment
cp environments/production.env.example environments/production.env
# Edit the env file with your configuration
./scripts/deploy.sh production

```

### Standard Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to an existing environment
./scripts/deploy.sh staging

# Run post-deployment verification
./scripts/post_deploy_check.sh staging
./scripts/smoke-test.sh staging

```

### Using the Deployment CLI

```bash
# Deploy to AWS
flask deploy aws deploy --env production --region us-west-2

# Deploy to Azure
flask deploy azure deploy --env production --resource-group my-resource-group

# Deploy to Google Cloud
flask deploy gcp deploy --env production --project my-gcp-project

# Deploy to Kubernetes
flask deploy k8s deploy --env production --namespace my-namespace

```

## Environment Configuration

The platform supports multiple deployment environments, each with its own configuration:

| Environment | Purpose | Example Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Development | Local development | `environments/development.env.example` |
| Staging | Pre-production testing | `environments/staging.env.example` |
| Production | Live deployment | `environments/production.env.example` |

## Deployment Patterns

The platform supports several deployment patterns to accommodate different needs:

1. **Single-Node Deployment** - All components on a single server
2. **Multi-Node Deployment** - Distributed components across multiple servers
3. **High Availability Deployment** - Redundant components in multiple availability zones
4. **Multi-Region Deployment** - Components deployed across multiple geographic regions

See the architecture document for detailed information on these patterns.

## Security Features

Security is built into every aspect of the deployment system:

- TLS for all connections with strong cipher configurations
- Network segmentation and security groups
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) with customized rule sets
- Automated security updates and vulnerability scanning
- Defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers

For comprehensive security information, refer to the security documentation.

## Monitoring and Alerts

The platform includes comprehensive monitoring:

- Real-time metrics collection with Prometheus
- Visualization dashboards with Grafana
- Centralized logging with ELK Stack
- Alerting system with multiple notification channels

See the monitoring guide for configuration details.

## Disaster Recovery

The platform includes a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy to handle various failure scenarios:

- Regular automated backups
- Cross-region data replication
- Documented recovery procedures
- Regular DR testing

See the disaster recovery plan for detailed procedures.

## Scaling Strategy

The platform supports both vertical and horizontal scaling to accommodate changing workloads:

- Automatic scaling based on load metrics
- Manual scaling procedures for planned capacity changes
- Component-specific scaling recommendations

See the scaling strategy document for implementation details.

## CI/CD Integration

The deployment system integrates with CI/CD pipelines:

- Support for multiple CI/CD providers
- Automated testing and quality gates
- Security scanning integration
- Automated deployment to multiple environments

Configuration files for various CI/CD systems are available in the ci directory.

## Runbooks

Common operational procedures are documented in runbooks:

- Rollback procedures
- Performance testing guide
- Monitoring setup and alerts

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Deployment script fails | Check the logs for specific errors and ensure all prerequisites are met |
| Monitoring alerts not firing | Verify alertmanager configuration and connectivity |
| Database connection errors | Check network security groups and database credentials |
| SSL/TLS issues | Verify certificate validity and configuration |
