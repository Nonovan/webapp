# Cloud Infrastructure Platform Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the Cloud Infrastructure Platform, including its components, relationships, and deployment patterns across environments.

## Overview

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform is designed as a modular, cloud-agnostic application with microservices-inspired architecture. It provides infrastructure management, monitoring, and automation capabilities while maintaining high availability, scalability, and security.

## Core Components

   - Web interface
   - API gateway
   - CLI tools
   - Notification systems

2. **Business Logic Layer**
   - Core services
   - Workflow engine
   - Automation engine
   - Orchestration services

3. **Data Layer**
   - Primary database (PostgreSQL)
   - Caching layer (Redis)
   - Object storage
   - Time-series metrics storage

4. **Integration Layer**
   - Cloud provider connectors
   - Webhook handlers
   - External API integrations
   - Event bus

### Key Services

| Service | Purpose | Technology | Deployment Pattern |
|---------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| API Service | RESTful endpoints for platform interaction | Flask/Python | Containerized, Horizontally scaled |
| Web UI | User interface | Flask/Jinja2 templates | Containerized, Horizontally scaled |
| Authentication Service | Identity and access management | Custom/OAuth2/OIDC | Containerized, Horizontally scaled |
| Task Worker | Background job processing | Celery/Python | Containerized, Horizontally scaled |
| Monitoring Service | System and application monitoring | Custom/Prometheus | Containerized, Horizontally scaled |
| Notification Service | Alerts and user notifications | Custom/Python | Containerized, Horizontally scaled |
| Database | Persistent data storage | PostgreSQL | VM/Managed service, Vertically scaled |
| Cache | Performance optimization | Redis | Containerized/Managed service, Clustered |
| Message Queue | Asynchronous processing | Redis/RabbitMQ | Containerized/Managed service, Clustered |

## Database Architecture

### Schema Design

The database follows a normalized schema design with focused tables that map to domain models. Key schema components include:

- Users and permissions
- Cloud resources and configurations
- Monitoring data (metadata, not time-series)
- Audit logs
- Workflow definitions and state

### Data Flow

1. Application services communicate with the database through ORM (SQLAlchemy)
2. Read-heavy operations leverage caching and read replicas
3. Write operations go to the primary database node
4. Time-series data flows to specialized storage

## API Architecture

The platform exposes REST APIs organized into the following categories:

- `/api/auth/` - Authentication and authorization endpoints
- `/api/cloud/` - Cloud resource management endpoints
- `/api/webhooks/` - Webhook registration and delivery endpoints
- `/api/monitor/` - Monitoring and alerting endpoints
- `/api/newsletter/` - Communication and notification endpoints

APIs follow these design principles:
- Resource-oriented design
- Consistent error handling
- API versioning
- Comprehensive documentation via Swagger/OpenAPI

## Security Architecture

The platform implements a defense-in-depth security approach:

### Network Security
- TLS for all connections
- Network segmentation
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- DDoS protection

### Application Security
- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Rate limiting

### Data Security
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Data classification
- Access controls
- Audit logging

### Operational Security
- Automated security testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Patch management
- Security monitoring

## Deployment Architecture

### Deployment Patterns

The platform supports multiple deployment patterns:

1. **Single-Node Deployment**
   - All components on one server
   - Suitable for development and small deployments
   - Minimal resource requirements

2. **Multi-Node Deployment**
   - Components distributed across multiple servers
   - Separate database and application servers
   - Suitable for medium-sized deployments

3. **High Availability Deployment**
   - Redundant components in multiple availability zones
   - Database replication with automatic failover
   - Load balancing across multiple application servers
   - Suitable for production environments

4. **Multi-Region Deployment**
   - Components deployed across multiple geographic regions
   - Global load balancing
   - Cross-region data replication
   - Highest availability and disaster recovery capabilities

### Container Orchestration

For containerized deployments, the platform supports:

- Kubernetes with defined resource requests/limits
- Docker Compose for simpler deployments
- AWS ECS/EKS, Azure AKS, or GCP GKE for managed Kubernetes

## Scalability Architecture

The platform is designed to scale both vertically and horizontally:

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless web/API servers can scale horizontally
- Worker nodes scale based on queue depth
- Read replicas for database read scaling

### Vertical Scaling
- Database primary node can scale vertically
- Cache instances can scale vertically for memory-intensive operations
- Worker nodes can scale vertically for compute-intensive tasks

### Auto-scaling
- Based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics
- Scheduled scaling for predictable load patterns
- Burst scaling for handling traffic spikes

## High Availability Architecture

The platform achieves high availability through:

1. **Redundancy**
   - Multiple instances of each component
   - No single points of failure
   - Geographic distribution where appropriate

2. **Automated Recovery**
   - Self-healing capabilities
   - Health checks and automated restarts
   - Failover mechanisms

3. **Load Distribution**
   - Load balancing across components
   - Connection pooling
