## Overview

The security filters provide specialized detection patterns and rules for security tools like Fail2ban and ModSecurity WAF. These filters implement custom detection logic to identify malicious activities, authentication failures, attack patterns, and suspicious behaviors in logs and web traffic. The filters are organized by security tool and protection category, allowing for modular implementation and granular security controls.

## Key Components

- **`fail2ban-filters/`**: Fail2ban filter configurations
  - Brute force attempt identification
  - Chain filtering for complex detection
  - Detection patterns for authentication failures
  - Filter syntax for system and application logs
  - Log pattern recognition rules

- **`waf/`**: Web Application Firewall rules by category
  - API-specific protection rules
  - Authentication attack prevention
  - Command injection detection
  - Industrial Control System (ICS) protection
  - IP reputation-based filtering
  - Path traversal detection rules
  - Request rate and size limiting
  - Sensitive data exposure prevention
  - SQL injection prevention patterns
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection

## Filter Types

### Fail2ban Filters

Fail2ban filters detect patterns in log files that indicate malicious activities, such as:

- **Access Attempts to Restricted Areas**: Unauthorized access attempts to sensitive resources
- **Authentication Failures**: Repeated login failures for admin interfaces and API endpoints
- **Abnormal Usage Patterns**: Unusual request patterns that may indicate abuse
- **Rate Limit Violations**: Excessive requests that trigger rate limiting
- **Web Attack Patterns**: Signatures of common web attacks in access logs

### WAF Rules

ModSecurity WAF rules implement detection and prevention for various attacks:

- **API Protection**: Specific rules for API security, including parameter validation and method restrictions
- **Authentication Protection**: Rules to prevent authentication bypass and credential stuffing
- **Command Injection**: Detection patterns for OS command injection attempts
- **File Upload**: Secure validation and handling of uploaded files
- **Generic Attacks**: Common web attack patterns and protections
- **ICS Protection**: Specialized rules for Industrial Control System interfaces
- **IP Reputation**: Rules utilizing IP reputation data to block known malicious sources
- **Path Traversal**: Detection of directory traversal and path manipulation attacks
- **Request Limits**: Controls for request size, frequency, and content types
- **Sensitive Data**: Rules to prevent exposure of sensitive information
- **SQL Injection**: Detection patterns for SQL injection attempts
- **XSS Protection**: Rules to detect and block cross-site scripting attacks

## Usage and Integration

### Integrating Fail2ban Filters

```bash
# Copy fail2ban filters to the appropriate directory
sudo cp fail2ban-filters/*.conf /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/

# Edit the jail configuration to use the filters
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

# Example jail configuration:
# [cloud-platform-api-auth]
# enabled = true
# filter = cloud-platform-api-auth
# logpath = /var/log/cloud-platform/api.log
# maxretry = 5
# bantime = 3600
# findtime = 300

# Restart fail2ban to apply changes
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

### Integrating WAF Rules

```bash
# Copy WAF rules to the ModSecurity configuration directory
sudo cp waf/*.conf /etc/nginx/modsecurity.d/waf-rules/

# Include the rules in the main ModSecurity configuration
sudo nano /etc/nginx/modsecurity.d/modsecurity-rules.conf

# Add include directives for each rule file:
# Include /etc/nginx/modsecurity.d/waf-rules/sql-injection.conf
# Include /etc/nginx/modsecurity.d/waf-rules/xss-protection.conf
# ...

# Test the configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Reload nginx to apply changes
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Customization Guidelines

When customizing these filters:

1. **Environmental Context**
   - Adjust rule sensitivity based on the environment (development/staging/production)
   - Implement stricter rules in production for critical systems
   - Increase log verbosity in lower environments for debugging

2. **False Positive Mitigation**
   - Add exceptions for legitimate business cases
   - Monitor and tune detection thresholds
   - Start with detection-only mode before enabling blocking
   - Test thoroughly with real traffic patterns

3. **Security Balance**
   - Balance security with usability requirements
   - Consider implementing progressive security measures
   - Implement tiered approach based on URI sensitivity
   - Use appropriate whitelisting for trusted sources

## Best Practices

- **Audit Logging**: Ensure proper logging of filter actions for investigation
- **Documentation**: Document filter purpose and customizations
- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring to detect excessive blocking
- **Performance Considerations**: Test filter performance under load before deployment
- **Regular Updates**: Review and update filters monthly as attack patterns evolve
- **Security Testing**: Include filters in regular security testing
- **Testing**: Validate filters with known-good and known-bad traffic
- **Version Control**: Maintain filter versioning for rollback capability
