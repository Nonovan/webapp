## Overview

The security filters provide specialized detection patterns and rules for security tools like Fail2ban and ModSecurity WAF. These filters implement custom detection logic to identify malicious activities, authentication failures, attack patterns, and suspicious behaviors in logs and web traffic. The filters are organized by security tool and protection category, allowing for modular implementation and granular security controls.

## Key Components

- **`fail2ban-filters/`**: Fail2ban filter configurations
  - Detection patterns for authentication failures
  - Brute force attempt identification
  - Log pattern recognition rules
  - Filter syntax for system and application logs
  - Chain filtering for complex detection

- **`waf/`**: Web Application Firewall rules by category
  - API-specific protection rules
  - Authentication attack prevention
  - Command injection detection
  - Industrial Control System (ICS) protection
  - IP reputation-based filtering
  - Path traversal detection rules
  - Request rate and size limiting
  - Sensitive data exposure prevention
  - SQL injection prevention patterns
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection

## Filter Types

### Fail2ban Filters

Fail2ban filters detect patterns in log files that indicate malicious activities, such as:

- **Authentication Failures**: Repeated login failures for admin interfaces and API endpoints
- **Access Attempts to Restricted Areas**: Unauthorized access attempts to sensitive resources
- **Rate Limit Violations**: Excessive requests that trigger rate limiting
- **Web Attack Patterns**: Signatures of common web attacks in access logs
- **Abnormal Usage Patterns**: Unusual request patterns that may indicate abuse

### WAF Rules

ModSecurity WAF rules implement detection and prevention for various attacks:

- **API Protection**: Specific rules for API security, including parameter validation and method restrictions
- **Authentication Protection**: Rules to prevent authentication bypass and credential stuffing
- **Command Injection**: Detection patterns for OS command injection attempts
- **ICS Protection**: Specialized rules for Industrial Control System interfaces
- **IP Reputation**: Rules utilizing IP reputation data to block known malicious sources
- **Path Traversal**: Detection of directory traversal and path manipulation attacks
- **Request Limits**: Controls for request size, frequency, and content types
- **Sensitive Data**: Rules to prevent exposure of sensitive information
- **SQL Injection**: Detection patterns for SQL injection attempts
- **XSS Protection**: Rules to detect and block cross-site scripting attacks

## Usage and Integration

### Integrating Fail2ban Filters

```bash
# Copy fail2ban filters to the appropriate directory
sudo cp fail2ban-filters/*.conf /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/

# Edit the jail configuration to use the filters
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

# Example jail configuration:
# [cloud-platform-api-auth]
# enabled = true
# filter = cloud-platform-api-auth
# logpath = /var/log/cloud-platform/api.log
# maxretry = 5
# bantime = 3600
# findtime = 300

# Restart fail2ban to apply changes
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

### Integrating WAF Rules

```bash
# Copy WAF rules to the ModSecurity configuration directory
sudo cp waf/*.conf /etc/nginx/modsecurity.d/waf-rules/

# Include the rules in the main ModSecurity configuration
sudo nano /etc/nginx/modsecurity.d/modsecurity-rules.conf

# Add include directives for each rule file:
# Include /etc/nginx/modsecurity.d/waf-rules/sql-injection.conf
# Include /etc/nginx/modsecurity.d/waf-rules/xss-protection.conf
# ...

# Test the configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Reload nginx to apply changes
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Customization Guidelines

When customizing these filters:

1. **Environmental Context**
   - Adjust rule sensitivity based on the environment (development/staging/production)
   - Increase log verbosity in lower environments for debugging
   - Implement stricter rules in production for critical systems

2. **False Positive Mitigation**
   - Start with detection-only mode before enabling blocking
   - Test thoroughly with real traffic patterns
   - Add exceptions for legitimate business cases
   - Monitor and tune detection thresholds

3. **Security Balance**
   - Balance security with usability requirements
   - Consider implementing progressive security measures
   - Use appropriate whitelisting for trusted sources
   - Implement tiered approach based on URI sensitivity

## Best Practices

- **Regular Updates**: Review and update filters monthly as attack patterns evolve
- **Performance Considerations**: Test filter performance under load before deployment
- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring to detect excessive blocking
- **Documentation**: Document filter purpose and customizations
- **Testing**: Validate filters with known-good and known-bad traffic
- **Version Control**: Maintain filter versioning for rollback capability
- **Security Testing**: Include filters in regular security testing
- **Audit Logging**: Ensure proper logging of filter actions for investigation
