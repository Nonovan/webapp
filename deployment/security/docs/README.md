# Documentation Symlinks for Security Configuration

This directory contains symbolic links to security documentation located elsewhere in the project. These symlinks provide convenient access to critical security documentation directly from the security components directory without duplicating content.

## Overview

The documentation symlinks directory centralizes references to security-related documentation that is distributed throughout the project. By maintaining these symlinks, we ensure that security administrators can easily access all relevant documentation when working with security configurations while maintaining the principle of Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) for documentation content. The symlinks point to authoritative documentation in their original locations but make them accessible in a security-focused context.

## Symlink Management

Symlinks are managed using the following commands:

```bash
# Create a new symlink
ln -s /path/to/original/document.md deployment/security/docs/document.md

# Update the target of a symlink
ln -sf /path/to/new/location/document.md deployment/security/docs/document.md

# Verify symlink targets
ls -la deployment/security/docs/
```

### Maintaining Symlinks

When managing these symlinks:

1. Always use relative paths from the project root when possible
2. Verify symlink targets exist before committing changes
3. Update symlinks when target documents change location
4. Ensure symlinks point to the authoritative source document
5. Maintain alphabetical order of symlinks for better organization

## Usage Guidelines

- Reference these documents when implementing security configurations
- Do not modify the target documents through these symlinks
- Instead, edit the original documentation files directly
- When adding new security documentation:
  1. Create the document in the appropriate documentation directory
  2. Add a symlink here with a descriptive name
  3. Update this README to include the new document
