# Security Components - Cloud Infrastructure Platform

This directory contains security-related configurations, hardening scripts, and documentation used to secure the Cloud Infrastructure Platform in various environments.

## Overview

The Cloud Infrastructure Platform security implementation follows a defense-in-depth approach with multiple layers of security controls to protect infrastructure, applications, data, and network communications. Our implementation adheres to industry best practices including NIST Cybersecurity Framework, CIS benchmarks, and OWASP recommendations.

## Key Security Features

- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: ModSecurity with OWASP Core Rule Set and custom rules
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention**: Fail2ban and IP reputation-based blocking
- **File Integrity Monitoring**: AIDE for detecting unauthorized file changes
- **Secure Communication**: TLS 1.2/1.3 with strong cipher configuration
- **Automated Security Updates**: Scheduled security patch deployment
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege for all components
- **Security Auditing**: Automated security compliance scanning and reporting
- **Perimeter Defense**: IP-based access controls and network security policies
- **Disaster Recovery**: Security configurations included in DR procedures

## Hardening Standards

Our security implementation follows these hardening standards:

- CIS Benchmarks for Linux, NGINX, and Kubernetes
- NIST SP 800-53 security controls
- OWASP Security Standards for web applications
- DISA STIG compliance where applicable

## Security Monitoring

Security monitoring is implemented through:

- Centralized logging with security event correlation
- Real-time alerts for security incidents
- Periodic security scans and vulnerability assessments
- Automated compliance reporting

## Maintenance and Updates

1. **Regular Updates**:
    - Update WAF rules monthly: `update-modsecurity-rules.sh`
    - Update system security packages: Handled by security-update-cron
2. **Security Auditing**:
    - Run quarterly security audits: `security-audit.sh --full`
    - Review and address findings in audit reports
3. **Certificate Management**:
    - Monitor certificate expiration: `certificate-renew.sh --check-only`
    - Renew certificates before expiration: `certificate-renew.sh`

## Compliance

The security implementation helps maintain compliance with:

- ISO 27001
- SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- PCI DSS (where applicable)
- HIPAA (where applicable)
- FedRAMP (in progress)
