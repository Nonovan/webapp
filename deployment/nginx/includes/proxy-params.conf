# Common Proxy Parameters for Cloud Infrastructure Platform
# Include this file in location blocks that use proxy_pass

# Standard proxy headers
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;

# Request ID tracking
proxy_set_header X-Request-ID $request_id;

# WebSocket support (properly configured)
proxy_http_version 1.1;
# Don't set empty Connection header as it breaks WebSockets
# Instead, conditionally set Connection for WebSockets in location blocks that need it
# Example: proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

# Proxy timeout settings (slightly adjusted for better reliability)
proxy_connect_timeout 30s;   # Reduced to improve error detection
proxy_send_timeout 60s;
proxy_read_timeout 60s;

# Proxy buffer settings
proxy_buffer_size 8k;        # Increased to handle larger headers
proxy_buffers 16 8k;         # Optimized for modern traffic patterns
proxy_busy_buffers_size 64k;
proxy_temp_file_write_size 64k;

# Security headers - don't pass on sensitive headers
proxy_hide_header X-Powered-By;
proxy_hide_header X-Runtime;
proxy_hide_header X-AspNet-Version;
proxy_hide_header X-AspNetMvc-Version;
proxy_hide_header Server;

# Don't change URLs in headers
proxy_redirect off;

# Add security context
proxy_set_header X-Client-IP $remote_addr;
# Only pass SSL client verify if SSL is being used
proxy_set_header X-Client-Verify $ssl_client_verify;
# Pass SSL client certificate if available
proxy_set_header X-SSL-Client-Cert $ssl_client_cert;

# Pass the original host requested by the client
proxy_set_header X-Original-Host $http_host;

# Cookie handling - instead of stripping all cookies, pass them through
# This is safer as many applications require cookies
# Specific locations can override this if needed
# proxy_set_header Cookie ""; # Commented out as it breaks most applications

# Control caching behavior - don't cache by default
proxy_no_cache 1;
proxy_cache_bypass 1;

# Handle errors gracefully by intercepting backend errors
proxy_intercept_errors on;

# Enable keepalive connections to upstream servers
# This significantly improves performance
proxy_socket_keepalive on;
keepalive_timeout 65;
keepalive_requests 100;

# Compression settings for proxied content
proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding "";  # Remove client encoding header to allow NGINX to handle compression
