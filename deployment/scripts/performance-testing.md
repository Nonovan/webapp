# Performance Testing Guide

This guide outlines the procedures and best practices for performance testing the Cloud Infrastructure Platform.

## Overview

Performance testing assesses the speed, responsiveness, reliability, scalability, and resource usage of the application under various load conditions. We use a combination of tools and methodologies to ensure the platform meets our performance requirements.

## Performance Metrics

We track the following key metrics:

- **Response Time**: Time to respond to a request (average, 95th percentile, 99th percentile)
- **Throughput**: Number of requests processed per second
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of requests that result in errors
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
- **Database Performance**: Query execution times and connection pool efficiency
- **Scalability**: How metrics change as load increases

## Testing Tools

Our primary performance testing tools include:

1. **Apache Bench (ab)**: For simple HTTP endpoint testing
2. **JMeter**: For complex test scenarios and distributed load testing
3. **Locust**: For Python-based load testing with real-time monitoring
4. **performance-test.sh**: Our custom script for quick performance checks

## Testing Process

### Quick Performance Check

For a quick performance check on any environment:

```bash
# Run with default settings (10 concurrent users, 30 seconds)
./performance-test.sh staging

# Customize test parameters
./performance-test.sh production --users 50 --duration 60

```

### Comprehensive Performance Test

For comprehensive performance testing:

1. **Setup Test Environment**
    - Ensure the environment is isolated or that testing won't impact users
    - Configure monitoring to capture detailed metrics during the test
    - Prepare test data if needed
2. **Define Test Scenarios**
    - Identify critical user journeys to test
    - Define expected load patterns (steady, spike, ramp-up)
    - Set performance targets and acceptance criteria
3. **Execute Performance Tests**
    
    ```bash
    # Using JMeter for complex scenarios
    jmeter -n -t deployment/performance/test-plans/full-user-journey.jmx -l results.csv
    
    # Using our custom script for API testing
    ./performance-test.sh staging --endpoints api-endpoints.txt --duration 300 --users 100
    
    ```
    
4. **Analyze Results**
    - Compare results against performance targets
    - Identify bottlenecks and performance issues
    - Document findings and recommendations

### Types of Performance Tests

### 1. Load Testing

Testing with expected normal and peak load:

```bash
# Normal load (50 concurrent users for 10 minutes)
./performance-test.sh staging --users 50 --duration 600

# Peak load (200 concurrent users for 10 minutes)
./performance-test.sh staging --users 200 --duration 600

```

### 2. Stress Testing

Testing system behavior beyond normal capacity:

```bash
# Stress test with 500 concurrent users
./performance-test.sh staging --users 500 --duration 300 --ramp-up 60

```

### 3. Endurance Testing

Testing system behavior under load over an extended period:

```bash
# 4-hour endurance test with moderate load
./performance-test.sh staging --users 100 --duration 14400

```

### 4. Spike Testing

Testing system response to sudden traffic spikes:

```bash
# Spike test with rapid user increase
./performance-test.sh staging --users 300 --duration 300 --spike-pattern "50,50,300,300,50,50"

```

## Performance Optimization

When performance issues are identified:

1. **Database Optimization**
    - Add or optimize indexes
    - Review and optimize slow queries
    - Implement query caching where appropriate
2. **Application Optimization**
    - Implement caching strategies
    - Optimize resource-intensive operations
    - Review and optimize API endpoints
3. **Infrastructure Scaling**
    - Scale vertically (increase resources)
    - Scale horizontally (add more instances)
    - Implement load balancing

## Performance Test Reports

Performance test reports are stored in `/var/www/reports/performance/` and include:

- Summary of test configuration and methodology
- Key performance metrics and their results
- Comparison with previous test results and baselines
- Visualizations of performance data
- Recommendations for optimization

## Automation and CI/CD Integration

Performance tests are integrated into our CI/CD pipeline:

- Basic performance tests run on every PR
- Comprehensive tests run nightly and before production deployments
- Performance regression alerts are automatically generated

## Best Practices

1. **Realistic Testing**: Use realistic data and user behavior patterns
2. **Isolation**: Perform tests in isolated environments when possible
3. **Baseline Comparison**: Always compare against established baselines
4. **Regular Testing**: Schedule regular performance tests, not just before releases
5. **Test Data Management**: Use representative test data that mimics production
6. **Monitoring Integration**: Combine test results with monitoring data for complete analysis

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **High Response Time**: Check database queries, external services, and resource contention
- **Low Throughput**: Examine connection limits, thread pool settings, and bottlenecks
- **High Error Rate**: Review logs for exceptions, timeout settings, and resource limits
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Monitor CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network bandwidth during tests
