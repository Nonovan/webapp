# Migrations

Migrations are a way to manage and version control changes to your database schema over time. They allow you to apply, revert, and track changes in a structured and consistent manner.

## How Migrations Work

1. **Create a Migration**: A migration file is generated to define changes to the database schema, such as creating tables, adding columns, or modifying indexes.
2. **Apply the Migration**: The migration is executed to apply the changes to the database.
3. **Track Changes**: Each migration is recorded in a migration history table to ensure changes are applied in the correct order and prevent duplicate executions.
4. **Revert Changes**: Migrations can be rolled back to undo changes if needed.

## Common Commands

- **Generate a Migration**: Create a new migration file.
- **Apply Migrations**: Apply all pending migrations to the database.
- **Rollback Migrations**: Revert the last applied migration or a specific migration.

## Best Practices

- Always review generated migration files before applying them.
- Test migrations in a staging environment before applying them to production.
- Keep migration files under version control to ensure consistency across environments.
